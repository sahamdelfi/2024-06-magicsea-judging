# Inability to Resume Reward Distribution in `BaseRewarder`  Contract

## Summary
The `BaseRewarder` contract lacks functionality to resume reward distribution once it has been stopped.
## Vulnerability Detail
The contract includes a `stop()` function that halts the reward distribution by setting `_isStopped` to true. However, there is no corresponding mechanism implemented to resume the reward distribution once it has been stopped.
## Impact
If a temporary pause in rewards is needed, the current implementation necessitates a more complex process to restart rewards.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a `resume()` function that allows the contract owner to restart the reward distribution.
