# Missing Index Check in `getVotedPoolsAtIndex` Function of `Voter.sol`

## Summary
The `getVotedPoolsAtIndex`  function in the Voter contract lacks a check to ensure the index is within bounds, potentially causing out-of-bounds access and transaction reverts.
## Vulnerability Detail
The function `getVotedPoolsAtIndex` directly accesses the `_votes` map using the at function from the `EnumerableMap` library without checking if the provided index is less than the length of the map.
## Impact
This issue can lead to transaction reverts, causing denial of service for legitimate users trying to retrieve data with a valid index.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a check to ensure the index is within bounds before calling the at function
```solidity
function getVotedPoolsAtIndex(uint256 index) external view returns (address, uint256) {
    require(index < _votes.length(), "Index out of bounds");
    return _votes.at(index);
}
```
