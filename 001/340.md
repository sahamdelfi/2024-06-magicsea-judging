# Users are able to front-run reward distribution

## Summary
The design of MlumStaking allows the risk of sandwich attack where the users only stake before reward distribution and withdraw immediately after harvesting the reward.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the MlumStaking contract, users need to stake their token to get a shares of the staking pool. By design, the reward will be transferred directly to the pool and only accounted for when the `_updatePool()` function is called.

On the other hand, users have no restriction over the locking duration of their stake. Users can always have the option to withdraw all their stake right after staking. 

As a result, users could abuse the mechanism to only stake right before the reward is transferred to the pool (by front-running the transfer reward TX). Then after reward are transferred in, they harvest and withdraw their stake right after that. This mean they still earn all the reward but barely locking their tokens.

## Impact
Unfair reward distribution for the users who has staked for a long time.
