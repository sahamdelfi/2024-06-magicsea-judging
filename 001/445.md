# Precision Loss Due to Division Before Multiplication in `BribeRewarder:_calculateRewards` function

## Summary
`BribeRewarder:_calculateRewards` function is vulnerable to precision loss and will lead to calculate less reward then expected.
## Vulnerability Detail
If we look at function `_calculateRewards`
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/rewarders/BribeRewarder.sol#L300-L313
it calculates duration , which will be `14 days (1209600 sec)`
```solidity
duration = endTime - startTime;
```
Then `emissionsPerSecond` is calculated using 
```solidity
emissionsPerSecond = _amountPerPeriod / duration; //@audit If  _amountPerPeriod will be less than1209600, then emissionsPerSecondwill be rounded to 0
```
If  `_amountPerPeriod` will be less than1209600, then  `emissionsPerSecond` will be rounded to 0 , It is very much possible as reward token can be usdc which uses decimal as 6. 
In next step `_calculateRewards` returns the reward using `emissionsPerSecond`.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/rewarders/BribeRewarder.sol#L312
So here `emissionsPerSecond` is getting multiplied with `timestamp - lastUpdateTimestamp`, this will lead to high precision loss in case of token having less decimals like usdc.

## Impact
Loss of rewards for the users, also due to rounding issue funds will get locked.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
```diff
        uint256 lastUpdateTimestamp = _lastUpdateTimestamp;
        uint256 timestamp = block.timestamp > endTime ? endTime : block.timestamp;
-      return timestamp > lastUpdateTimestamp ? (timestamp - lastUpdateTimestamp) * emissionsPerSecond : 0;
+     return timestamp > lastUpdateTimestamp ? ((timestamp - lastUpdateTimestamp) * _amountPerPeriod) / duration : 0;
```

*  Or use some higher Precisions
