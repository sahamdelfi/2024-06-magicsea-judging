# Malicious user can deploy 5 BribeRewarders for uint max periods of given pool

## Summary

Due to the permissionless nature of BribeRewarder registration, malicious users can block the bribe registration from pool owners, preventing them from providing additional incentives for voting.

## Vulnerability Detail

Everyone can deploy a new `BribeRewarder` contract with any token he wants, register for as many periods, and fund as much as he wants, even 0. 

Additionally, there is a limit on the BribeRewarders that can register for the pool per period. 

Knowing that everyone can deploy 5 `BribeRewarders` per pool and bribe with all of them for the periods starting from `_currentVotingPeriod` + 1 to uint256 max. 

```solidity
function bribe(uint256 startId, uint256 lastId, uint256 amountPerPeriod) public onlyOwner {
      _bribe(startId, lastId, amountPerPeriod);
  }

function _bribe(uint256 startId, uint256 lastId, uint256 amountPerPeriod) internal {
      _checkAlreadyInitialized();
      if (lastId < startId) revert BribeRewarder__WrongEndId();
      if (amountPerPeriod == 0) revert BribeRewarder__ZeroReward();

      IVoter voter = IVoter(_caller);

      if (startId <= voter.getCurrentVotingPeriod()) {
          revert BribeRewarder__WrongStartId();
      }

      uint256 totalAmount = _calcTotalAmount(startId, lastId, amountPerPeriod);

      uint256 balance = _balanceOfThis(_token());

      if (balance < totalAmount) revert BribeRewarder__InsufficientFunds();

      _startVotingPeriod = startId;
      _lastVotingPeriod = lastId;
      _amountPerPeriod = amountPerPeriod;

      // create rewads per period
      uint256 bribeEpochs = _calcPeriods(startId, lastId);
      for (uint256 i = 0; i <= bribeEpochs; ++i) {
          _rewards.push();
      }

      _lastUpdateTimestamp = block.timestamp;

      IVoter(_caller).onRegister();

      emit BribeInit(startId, lastId, amountPerPeriod);
  }
```

As we see `amountPerPeriod` is a parameter that is passed by the user and can be 0. 

The problem will happen in `Voter::onRegister` and it is due to the fact that there is a max limit on the bribes:

```solidity
/**
   * @dev bribe rewarder registers itself
   * TODO check if rewarder is from allowed rewarderFactory
   */
  function onRegister() external override {
      IBribeRewarder rewarder = IBribeRewarder(msg.sender);

      _checkRegisterCaller(rewarder);

      uint256 currentPeriodId = _currentVotingPeriodId;
      (address pool, uint256[] memory periods) = rewarder.getBribePeriods();
      for (uint256 i = 0; i < periods.length; ++i) {
          // TODO check if rewarder token + pool  is already registered

          require(periods[i] >= currentPeriodId, "wrong period");
          require(_bribesPerPriod[periods[i]][pool].length + 1 <= Constants.MAX_BRIBES_PER_POOL, "too much bribes");
          _bribesPerPriod[periods[i]][pool].push(rewarder);
      }
  }
```

All these details open the possibility any user to block the additional incentive for any of the pools available for voting **forever.**

## Impact

Blockage of the bribe rewarding mechanism.

## Recommendation

Hard to give valid recommendation, but can think of making it permission required.
