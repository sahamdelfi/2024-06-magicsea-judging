# MasterchefV2::emergencyWithdraw unclaimed rewards are not zeroed

## Summary

`MasterchefV2::emergencyWithdraw` function does not set the important reward params to zero and allows users to exit whenever they want and deposit later to claim the rewards that have been accumulating.

## Vulnerability Detail

If we take a look at the `MasterchefV2::emergencyWithdraw` :

```solidity
/**
   * @dev Emergency withdraws tokens from a farm, without claiming any rewards.
   * @param pid The pool ID of the farm.
   */
  function emergencyWithdraw(uint256 pid) external override {
      Farm storage farm = _farms[pid];

      uint256 balance = farm.amounts.getAmountOf(msg.sender);
      int256 deltaAmount = -balance.toInt256();

      farm.amounts.update(msg.sender, deltaAmount);

      farm.token.safeTransfer(msg.sender, balance);

      emit PositionModified(pid, msg.sender, deltaAmount, 0);
  }
```

`unclaimedRewards` for that `msg.sender` is not zeroed, enabling him to withdraw without losing any rewards, as he will receive the accrued `lum` tokens once he deposit back in a later stage.

The problem with that approach is that users can exit and enter the system whenever they want knowing that their rewards are not lost, this gives them to opportunity to exit when `lum` reward distribution becomes diluted and sell their tokens for other opportunities, later on they deposit again continue accumulating reward tokens. 

## Impact

Despite intentions of the team, users who perform emergency withdrawal to lose their rewards, they will not be lost and will be claimable in a later stage. Important note is that this Masterchef implementation is different from the SushiSwap or StakingJoe ones, regarding the reward mechanism. The original implementation doesnâ€™t have `unclaimedRewards` mapping, but directly transfer the tokens to the `account`, while the one used in `MagicSea` uses pull-over-push approach making the issue possible.
