# No incentive to call emergencyWithdraw

## Summary

`emergencyWithdraw` has no incentive to be called and also will prevent users from withdrawing even when they don’t want to issue rewards if their positions are still locked.

## Vulnerability Detail

Emergency withdrawal functionality contains the exact same checks as the normal withdrawal function and will be rendered useless even for the users who don’t want the rewards because they are still forced to wait until their lock period has expired:

```solidity
function emergencyWithdraw(uint256 tokenId) external override nonReentrant {
      _requireOnlyOwnerOf(tokenId);

      StakingPosition storage position = _stakingPositions[tokenId];

      // position should be unlocked
      require(
          _unlockOperators.contains(msg.sender)
              || (position.startLockTime + position.lockDuration) <= _currentBlockTimestamp() || isUnlocked(),//NOTE why position should be expired?
          "locked"
      );
      // emergencyWithdraw: locked

      uint256 amount = position.amount;

      // update total lp supply
      _stakedSupply = _stakedSupply - amount;
      _stakedSupplyWithMultiplier = _stakedSupplyWithMultiplier - position.amountWithMultiplier;

      // destroy position (ignore boost points)
      _destroyPosition(tokenId);

      emit EmergencyWithdraw(tokenId, amount);
      stakedToken.safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);
  }
```

This is not the intention behind the original `Masterchef` implementation from where this functionality is taken.

Imagine there is an issue in the `MlumStaking` contract and users want to withdraw their staked tokens as fast as possible, but this will not be possible until their positions are still locked. 

The only possibility of them withdrawing before unlock is the admin of the contract to unlock the positions globally from `setEmergencyUnlock`

## Impact

`emergencyWithdrawal` is not functional and will prevent users from claiming their `stakedToken` in case of an **emergency.**

## Recommendation

Remove the checks whether the position is still locked.
