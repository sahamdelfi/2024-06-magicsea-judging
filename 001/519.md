# Approved users with approvedForAll cannot act over lsNFT

## Summary

NFT approved users with `setApprovalForAll` cannot act as a single approved user.

## Vulnerability Detail

NFT can be approved in 2 ways, by `approve` and by `setApprovalForAll`. `_requireOnlyApprovedOrOwnerOf` should allow approved users to call privilege functions of lsNFT, but since NFT can only have one approved user with `approve` and multiple with `setApprovalForAll`, if the caller is approved with `setApprovalForAll`, he cannot act over NFT because the `setApprovalForAll` check is missing.

[MlumStaking.sol#L148-L151](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/42e799446595c542eff9519353d3becc50cdba63/magicsea-staking/src/MlumStaking.sol#L148-L151)

```solidity
function _requireOnlyApprovedOrOwnerOf(uint256 tokenId) internal view {
    require(_ownerOf(tokenId) != address(0), "ERC721: operator query for nonexistent token");
    require(_isOwnerOf(msg.sender, tokenId) || getApproved(tokenId) == msg.sender, "FORBIDDEN");
}
```

## Impact

A user who is approved with `setApprovalForAll` cannot call functions in `MlumStaking.sol`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Change `_requireOnlyApprovedOrOwnerOf` to check for `ERC721::isApprovedForAll` as well, just like in `ERC721::_isAuthorized`.
