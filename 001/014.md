# Bribe rewards will not work for low decimal tokens

## Summary
Reward amount per second would be zero for low decimal tokens, causing reward distribution failure.

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
uint256 emissionsPerSecond = _amountPerPeriod / duration;
```
`duration` is expected to be `_periodDuration = 1209600`. For small token decimals (eg. 2, 3), `_amountPerPeriod` could be relatively small in comparison, leading to zero `emissionsPerSecond`.

## Impact
Reward distribution failure.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
No easy solution, as the voting period is mutable over the lifespan of the bribed voting periods. Could sanity check that `emissionsPerSecond` isn't zero for the current period duration.
