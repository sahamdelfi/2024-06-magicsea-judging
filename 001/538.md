High

# Attacker can front run an emergency call with a flash loan to gain high rewards for the current voting period.

## Summary
This is an edge case where its possible for an attacker to take advantage of an emergency situation in the protocol sandwiching the owner's transactions with a flash loan attack thereby increasing their own voting power. They can later claim their rewards which are unreasonable high due to the flash loan amount resulting in a loss to the protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail

Scenario:
- An emergency has occurred & the Owner sets the `_emergencyUnlock` to `true`.
- Attacker sees this & front-runs the Owner's call with a Flash loan.
- The attacker calls `createPosition()` to create a new position with  a huge amount & the lock duration set to `_maxLockDuration`. 
- This call is followed by the attacker calling the `vote()` in Voter.sol contract.
- All the validations check pass inside the `vote()`. Even the initialLockDuration & lockDuration checks because they been set to the `_maxLockDuration` when creating the position.
```solidity
File: Voter.sol

        function vote(uint256 tokenId, address[] calldata pools, uint256[] calldata deltaAmounts) external {
        if (pools.length != deltaAmounts.length) revert IVoter__InvalidLength();

        // check voting started
        if (!_votingStarted()) revert IVoter_VotingPeriodNotStarted();
        if (_votingEnded()) revert IVoter_VotingPeriodEnded();

        // check ownership of tokenId
        if (_mlumStaking.ownerOf(tokenId) != msg.sender) {
            revert IVoter__NotOwner();
        }

        uint256 currentPeriodId = _currentVotingPeriodId;
        // check if alreay voted
        if (_hasVotedInPeriod[currentPeriodId][tokenId]) {
            revert IVoter__AlreadyVoted();
        }

        // check if _minimumLockTime >= initialLockDuration and it is locked
        if (_mlumStaking.getStakingPosition(tokenId).initialLockDuration < _minimumLockTime) {
            revert IVoter__InsufficientLockTime();
        }
        if (_mlumStaking.getStakingPosition(tokenId).lockDuration < _periodDuration) {
            revert IVoter__InsufficientLockTime();
        }
        ...
```
- The attacker now has an abruptly high voting power because of the flash loan amount.
```solidity
179:         uint256 votingPower = _mlumStaking.getStakingPosition(tokenId).amountWithMultiplier;
```
- All the necessary variables are updated for that voting period.
- At this point Owner's `_emergencyUnlock` is activated.
```solidity
File: MlumStaking.sol
 
        function setEmergencyUnlock(bool emergencyUnlock_) external {
        _requireOnlyOwner();

        _emergencyUnlock = emergencyUnlock_;
        emit SetEmergencyUnlock(emergencyUnlock_);
    }
```
- The attacker calls `withdrawFromPosition()` in the MlumStaking.sol contract withdrawing all the deposited flash loan amount & harvesting some reward tokens if applicable. The call won't revert because if `isUnlocked()` is `true`, the lock duration isn't necessary.
```solidity
File: MlumStaking.sol

      function withdrawFromPosition(uint256 tokenId, uint256 amountToWithdraw) external nonReentrant {
        _requireOnlyApprovedOrOwnerOf(tokenId);

        _updatePool();
        address nftOwner = ERC721Upgradeable.ownerOf(tokenId);
        _withdrawFromPosition(nftOwner, tokenId, amountToWithdraw);
    }
```
```solidity
File: MlumStaking.sol

       function _withdrawFromPosition(address nftOwner, uint256 tokenId, uint256 amountToWithdraw) internal {
         require(amountToWithdraw > 0, "null");
         // withdrawFromPosition: amount cannot be null

         StakingPosition storage position = _stakingPositions[tokenId];
         require(
             _unlockOperators.contains(nftOwner)
                 || (position.startLockTime + position.lockDuration) <= _currentBlockTimestamp() || isUnlocked(),  // @note - isUnlocked is set to true 
             "locked"
         );
       ...
```
- The attacker pays all the flashloan.
- When the voting period ends for the `_currentVotingPeriodId` where the attacker the voted, he can claim his rewards which would be high resulting in a loss to the protocol.

## Impact
Attacker can earn very high rewards resulting in a loss to the protocol.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a check in the vote function which checks that a user can vote after 5-10 minutes has passed since the creation of a position's start time.
