# `addToPosition()` isn't disabled during emergency unlock

## Summary
`addToPosition()` doesn't have the `isUnlocked()` check that is present in `createPosition()` and `_lockPosition()`.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the event where emergency unlock is activated, locks should be disabled and users should only be able to withdraw positions. However, users are able to add to existing positions with `addToPosition()` because it doesn't have the `isUnlocked()` check.

## Impact
User action that should be blocked, isn't.

## Recommendation
Add the `isUnlocked()` check for `addToPosition()`.
