# BribeRewarder.sol::User can earn rewards in a votingPeriod even though that Period has ended for bribing in the BribeEpoch.

## Summary
User can earn reward for the currentVotingPeriod even though it comes after the last BribingEpoch mentioned by the BribeRewarder.
This issue is caused due to extra reward pushed to `_rewards`.
## Vulnerability Detail

Here we are iterating from `i=0` to `bribeEpochs` which means total number of times `_rewards.push()` called is `bribeEpochs+1`

```solidity
function _bribe(uint256 startId, uint256 lastId, uint256 amountPerPeriod){
    ....
    uint256 bribeEpochs = _calcPeriods(startId, lastId);
    for (uint256 i = 0; i <= bribeEpochs; ++i) {      //.. @audit i = 1
  
        _rewards.push();
    }
    ....
}
```
`bribeEpochs` contains the ids ranging from `startId` to `lastId`  includeing the  both `startId` and `lastId`.

```solidity
function _calcPeriods(uint256 startId, uint256 lastId) internal pure returns (uint256) {
        return (lastId - startId) + 1;
}
```

This means we are pushing an extra `_reward` which can be utilised by the voter to vote on the periodId post the `lastId` of the bribeEpoch.


## Impact
User can earn reawrds in a votingPeriod even though the votingPeriod has ended in the BribeEpoch.
