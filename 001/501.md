# Users cannot claim bribe rewards 2 periods after _lastVotingPeriod

## Summary

Users cannot claim Bribe rewards 2 periods after the `_lastVotingPeriod` of his BribeRewarder pass.

## Vulnerability Detail

Each Bribe Rewarder has a set of Voter periods and rewards are based on them. Rewarder can be registered with `startId` to `endId` only for future Voter periods.

Then the user associated with that rewarder can `claim()` rewards for each period. But due to a wrong implementation of `claim()`, if they don't claim by `BribeRewarder._lastVotingPeriod() + 2 periods`, they will never be able to claim their rewards.

This will happen because of 2 points:

- Bribe Rewarders have a specific `endPeriod`, but the Voter will continue to start new periods even after passing the specific Bribe Rewarder `endPeriod`.
- `claim()` gets the `latestFinishedPeriod` of the Voter, but when this is called after BribeRewarder's `endId`, `claim()` will loop more times than periods in the Rewarder, which will return out of bounds when indexing `_rewards`.

```solidity
function claim(uint256 tokenId) external override {
    uint256 endPeriod = IVoter(_caller).getLatestFinishedPeriod();

    uint256 totalAmount;

    // calc emission per period cause every period can every other durations
    for (uint256 i = _startVotingPeriod; i <= endPeriod; ++i) {
        totalAmount += _modify(i, tokenId, 0, true);
    }

    emit Claimed(tokenId, _pool(), totalAmount);
}
```

```solidity
function _modify(uint256 periodId, uint256 tokenId, int256 deltaAmount, bool isPayOutReward)
    private
    returns (uint256 rewardAmount)
{
    if (!IVoter(_caller).ownerOf(tokenId, msg.sender)) {
        revert BribeRewarder__NotOwner();
    }

    // extra check so we dont calc rewards before starttime
    (uint256 startTime,) = IVoter(_caller).getPeriodStartEndtime(periodId);
    if (block.timestamp <= startTime) {
        _lastUpdateTimestamp = startTime;
    }

    RewardPerPeriod storage reward = _rewards[_indexByPeriodId(periodId)]; // @audit - revert with out of bounds
    Amounts.Parameter storage amounts = reward.userVotes;
    Rewarder2.Parameter storage rewarder = reward.rewarder;
```

*Note: It will **revert** after `endPeriod + 2`, due to a wrong for loop in `bribe()` that adds 1 more row inside `_rewards`, but that's not a problem in this case, it just increases the claim window by 1 period.*

## Impact

Bribe rewards cannot be claimed if the user misses to call `BribeRewarder.claim()` between `_startVotingPeriod` and `_lastVotingPeriod+2`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Limit `endPeriod` inside `claim()` to `_lastVotingPeriod`.

```diff
function claim(uint256 tokenId) external override {
    uint256 endPeriod = IVoter(_caller).getLatestFinishedPeriod();
+   endPeriod = endPeriod >= _lastVotingPeriod ? _lastVotingPeriod : endPeriod;
    

    uint256 totalAmount;

    // calc emission per period cause every period can every other durations
    for (uint256 i = _startVotingPeriod; i <= endPeriod; ++i) {
        totalAmount += _modify(i, tokenId, 0, true);
    }

    emit Claimed(tokenId, _pool(), totalAmount);
}
```
