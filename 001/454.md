# _requireOnlyApprovedOrOwnerOf() reverts if approved by using ERC721Upgradeable.setApprovalForAll()

## Summary
```MlumStaking::_requireOnlyApprovedOrOwnerOf()``` returns true if the tokenId has been approved for another user by using ```ERC721Upgradeable.approve()``` function, but does not when it has been approved via ```ERC721Upgradeable.setApprovalForAll()```, which grants permission to a user to take any tokens that belong to the spender.

## Vulnerability Detail
```MlumStaking::_requireOnlyApprovedOrOwnerOf()``` takes into account two of the three possible checks, from which only one is necessary to be met in order to consider a token approved for another user: ```(owner == spender || isApprovedForAll(owner, spender) || _getApproved(tokenId) == spender)```. Among these, ``` isApprovedForAll(owner, spender)``` is not considered, therefore if a token has been approved this way, the spender will not be able to make any operations with it. This happens because ```_getApproved()``` checks the ```_tokenApprovals``` mapping, whereas ```isApprovedForAll()``` checks the ```_operatorApprovals``` mapping.
 
## Impact
Medium impact, as the likelihood of the vulnerability is not high, but it would prevent a token from being handled by its wished spender.

## Recommendation
Add this way of evaluating if a given token can be spent by a spender:

```solidity
function _requireOnlyApprovedOrOwnerOf(uint256 tokenId) internal view {
require(_ownerOf(tokenId) != address(0), "ERC721: operator query for nonexistent token");
- require(_isOwnerOf(msg.sender, tokenId) || getApproved(tokenId) == msg.sender, "FORBIDDEN");
+ require(isApprovedForAll(_ownerOf(tokenId), msg.sender) || _isOwnerOf(msg.sender, tokenId) || getApproved(tokenId) == msg.sender, "FORBIDDEN");
}
```
