# Multipliers in ```MlumStaking``` are incorrectly calculated in ```getMultiplierByLockDuration``` function.

## Vulnerability Detail
When a user wants to stake an amount of ```Mlum``` tokens, he can call the ```createPosition``` function and pass the amount of the tokens and the ```lockDuration``` he wants. Seeing the docs, he expects [these](https://docs.magicsea.finance/protocol/magic/magic-lum-staking) multipliers but due to the fact that ```getMultiplierByLockDuration``` is implemented incorrectly, the multipliers he is getting is not the one he expected. Lets see the ```getMultiplierByLockDuration``` function :
```solidity
    function getMultiplierByLockDuration(uint256 lockDuration) public view returns (uint256) {
        // in case of emergency unlock
        if (isUnlocked()) return 0;

        if (_maxLockDuration == 0 || lockDuration == 0) return 0;

        // capped to maxLockDuration
        if (lockDuration >= _maxLockDuration) return _maxLockMultiplier;

        return (_maxLockMultiplier * lockDuration) / (_maxLockDuration);
    }
```
This function returns multipliers that are not matched with the docs. Let's take for example 90 days which must have multiplier 1.5x as seen in the [docs](https://docs.magicsea.finance/protocol/magic/magic-lum-staking). The function will return :
```solidity
20000 * 7776000 / 31536000 = 4921
```
As we can see 4921 plus 10000 is equal 14921 which is not 15000 which is 1.5x. Also due to the rounding down users who deposit for under 26 minutes will get 0 multiplier while this should be the case. This is true because :
```solidity
20000 * 1560(26 minutes in seconds) / 31536000 = 0,98
```
```0,98``` in Solidity will be ```0```.

## Impact
This vulnerability leads to users do not take the multiplier they expected or do not take any multiplier at all even though they should have. As a result they get less rewards or their votes are reduced.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider calculating the multiplier a user gets to be exactly matched with these mutliplier shown in the docs.
