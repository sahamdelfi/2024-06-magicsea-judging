# Users with huge voting power are limited to allocation to many pools due to high gas consumption

## Summary

In case when `tokenId` has a lot of voting power, itâ€™s owner won't be able to allocate it to many pools because the `Voter::vote` function will run out of gas.

## Vulnerability Detail

Each `tokenId` owner can vote for as many pools as they wish as long as their voting power is sufficient, but only once per voting period. This creates a problem when a `tokenId` with a large voting power wants to allocate its votes to many pools and earn from all bribe rewards per pool and etc., but because of all the operations that happen in the `for loop` for a single pool, the function will run out of gas and he is forced to calculate and submit a number of pools that will be executed successfully, while the rest of his voting power cannot be used in that period, as `Voter::vote` can only be called once per period. Thus, **he is forced** to allocate to fewer pools due to the contract infrastructure design.

```solidity
function vote(uint256 tokenId, address[] calldata pools, uint256[] calldata deltaAmounts) external {
    if (pools.length != deltaAmounts.length) revert IVoter__InvalidLength();

    // check voting started
    if (!_votingStarted()) revert IVoter_VotingPeriodNotStarted();
    if (_votingEnded()) revert IVoter_VotingPeriodEnded();

    // check ownership of tokenId
    if (_mlumStaking.ownerOf(tokenId) != msg.sender) {
        revert IVoter__NotOwner();
    }

    uint256 currentPeriodId = _currentVotingPeriodId;
    // check if alreay voted
    if (_hasVotedInPeriod[currentPeriodId][tokenId]) {
        revert IVoter__AlreadyVoted();
    }

    // check if _minimumLockTime >= initialLockDuration and it is locked
    if (_mlumStaking.getStakingPosition(tokenId).initialLockDuration < _minimumLockTime) {
        revert IVoter__InsufficientLockTime();
    }
    if (_mlumStaking.getStakingPosition(tokenId).lockDuration < _periodDuration) {
        revert IVoter__InsufficientLockTime();
    }

    uint256 votingPower = _mlumStaking.getStakingPosition(tokenId).amountWithMultiplier;

    // check if deltaAmounts > votingPower
    uint256 totalUserVotes;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < pools.length; ++i) {
        totalUserVotes += deltaAmounts[i];
    }

    if (totalUserVotes > votingPower) {
        revert IVoter__InsufficientVotingPower();
    }

    IVoterPoolValidator validator = _poolValidator;

    for (uint256 i = 0; i < pools.length; ++i) {
        address pool = pools[i];

        if (address(validator) != address(0) && !validator.isValid(pool)) {
            revert Voter__PoolNotVotable();
        }

        uint256 deltaAmount = deltaAmounts[i];

        _userVotes[tokenId][pool] += deltaAmount;
        _poolVotesPerPeriod[currentPeriodId][pool] += deltaAmount;

        if (_votes.contains(pool)) {
            _votes.set(pool, _votes.get(pool) + deltaAmount);
        } else {
            _votes.set(pool, deltaAmount);
        }

        _notifyBribes(_currentVotingPeriodId, pool, tokenId, deltaAmount); // msg.sender, deltaAmount);
    }

    _totalVotes += totalUserVotes;

    _hasVotedInPeriod[currentPeriodId][tokenId] = true;

    emit Voted(tokenId, currentPeriodId, pools, deltaAmounts);
}
```

## Impact

User is forced to allocate to fewer pools or allocate more than he wants due to the gas limit even if he has voting power and because he cannot vote twice in a period.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Allow users to vote more than once if they have left voting power, or make restrict to vote for a pool twice in the same period.
