# Voter::vote will be always reverting in case BribeRewarder is registered

## Summary

Due to wrong NFT owner checks, voting in pools with active `BribeRewarders` will be impossible.

## Vulnerability Detail

The flow of user voting from `Voter` for pool with registered BriberRewarder is as follows: Voter::vote â†’ BribeRewarder::deposit. `msg.sender` in the BribeRewarder will be the `Voter` contract.

The problem lies in the `_modify` implementation as it checks if the `msg.sender` is the owner of this given `tokenId`, but the owner is the user itself, not the Voter contract and tx will revert:

```solidity

src: BribeRewarder.sol
function _modify(uint256 periodId, uint256 tokenId, int256 deltaAmount, bool isPayOutReward)
    private
    returns (uint256 rewardAmount)
{
    if (!IVoter(_caller).ownerOf(tokenId, msg.sender)) {
        revert BribeRewarder__NotOwner();
    }
..MORE CODE
}
```

```solidity
src: Voter.sol
function ownerOf(uint256 tokenId, address account) external view returns (bool) {
    return _mlumStaking.ownerOf(tokenId) == account;
}
```

This issue can be caused both intentionally or not, by simply registering any BribeRewarder for the given pool and period.

## Impact

Full dos of the voting functionality in case there are active `BribeRewarders` registered for the given pool
