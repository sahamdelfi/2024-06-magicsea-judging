# There is a race condition between MlumStaking.setLockMultiplierSettings and  MlumStaking.addToPosition(), as a result, user might loss rewards as a result.

## Summary
There is a race condition between MlumStaking.setLockMultiplierSettings and  MlumStaking.addToPosition(), as a result, user might loss rewards as a result.

## Vulnerability Detail
There is a race condition between MlumStaking.setLockMultiplierSettings and  MlumStaking.addToPosition().  On one hand, 
MlumStaking.addToPosition() will add new staking tokens to a user's existing position, it will use ```position.lockMultiplier = getMultiplierByLockDuration(position.initialLockDuration);
``` to calculate ```position.amountWithMultiplier``, which determines the amount of reward the user will receive.

However, although the comment says position.lockMultiplier should remain the same, the code uses ```position.lockMultiplier = getMultiplierByLockDuration(position.initialLockDuration);`` to recalculate ````position.lockMultiplier```. This is a problem, since function ```getMultiplierByLockDuration()``` will use two variables: ```_maxLockDuration```, and ```_maxLockMultiplie```.

Meanwhile, these two variables: ```_maxLockDuration```, and ```_maxLockMultiplie``` might be changed by function ```setLockMultiplierSettings```:

Therefore, there is a race condition between ```MlumStaking.setLockMultiplierSettings``` and  ```MlumStaking.addToPosition()```. If ```position.lockMultiplier``` is changed to a smaller value as a result, then the user will actually loss rewards. 

## Impact 
There is a race condition between MlumStaking.setLockMultiplierSettings and  MlumStaking.addToPosition(), as a result, user might loss rewards as a result.
