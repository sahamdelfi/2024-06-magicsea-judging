# Wrong execution flow of vote function causes users can't use their voting power

## Summary
While voting period is active, user can't use it's own voting power in different transactions due to wrong validation checks.
## Vulnerability Detail
Let say Alice created a position using 2 ether with 2 weeks and she wants to vote for pool X with her 50% voting power. Voting power is defined as following line:

uint256 votingPower = _pool.getStakingPosition(AliceTokenId).amountWithMultiplier;

After calling vote() for the first time, her tokenId is eliminated from all the other voting operations without checking the value of used voting power.
## Impact

It's a core system functionality. Voting power always should be equal to her position with multiplier. But user can't use it in separate transactions due to wrong sequence diagram.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/42e799446595c542eff9519353d3becc50cdba63/magicsea-staking/src/Voter.sol#L167C1-L169C10

```solidity
if (_hasVotedInPeriod[currentPeriodId][tokenId]) {
     revert IVoter__AlreadyVoted();
}
```
## Proof of Concept
Following test function can be used for testing:
```solidity
    function test_voteInSeparateTransactions() public {
        address user = ALICE;

        vm.prank(DEV);
        _voter.startNewVotingPeriod();

        _createPosition(user);
        
        vm.startPrank(user);
        uint256 votingPower = _pool.getStakingPosition(1).amountWithMultiplier;
        console.log("Voting power of Alice before vote: %s", votingPower);
        uint256[] memory partialVote = new uint256[](1);
        partialVote[0] = votingPower / 2;
        _voter.vote(1, _getDummyPools(), partialVote);
        // Voting power should be reduced by 50%
        console.log("Voting power of Alice after vote: %s", votingPower - votingPower / 2);
        console.log("Voting the remainning power...");
        _voter.vote(1, _getDummyPools(), partialVote);
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```
It logged following lines:
```console

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Storing voted amount in storage will solve the problem ( variable name should be configured again ):
