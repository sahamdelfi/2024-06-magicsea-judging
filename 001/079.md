# voters may lose some bribe rewarder if bribe rewarder's reward token is token with fee-on-transfer

## Summary
If the reward token is one token with fee-on-transfer in one bribe rewarder, there may be not enough tokens to the voters. Voters may lose some rewards.

## Vulnerability Detail
In BribeRewarder, the owner can deposit some reward tokens as the reward. And the voters' extra rewards will be calculated according to `amountPerPeriod`.
The vulnerability is that when the owners start bribe via `fundAndBribe`, reward tokens will be sent to the contract. If the reward token is one token with fee-on-transfer, the actual tokens in the contract might be less than expected amount. When users claim their rewards, the transaction might be reverted because there is not enough token balance to transfer to the voters.
Considering the worst scenario, only one voter vote for this pool in the period start block. The voter should claim all reward tokens for this period after the period ends. But he may claim nothing because the whole balance in the contract cannot pay the expected rewards.

```c
    function fundAndBribe(uint256 startId, uint256 lastId, uint256 amountPerPeriod) external payable onlyOwner {
        IERC20 token = _token();
        uint256 totalAmount = _calcTotalAmount(startId, lastId, amountPerPeriod);
        if (address(token) == address(0)) {
            if (msg.value < totalAmount) {
                revert BribeRewarder__InsufficientFunds();
            }
        } else {
            token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), totalAmount);
        }
        _bribe(startId, lastId, amountPerPeriod);
    }
    function _calculateRewards(uint256 periodId) internal view returns (uint256) {
        (uint256 startTime, uint256 endTime) = IVoter(_caller).getPeriodStartEndtime(periodId);
        ...
        uint256 duration = endTime - startTime;
        uint256 emissionsPerSecond = _amountPerPeriod / duration;

        uint256 lastUpdateTimestamp = _lastUpdateTimestamp;
        // if we exceed the endTime, we will use the endTime
        uint256 timestamp = block.timestamp > endTime ? endTime : block.timestamp;
        return timestamp > lastUpdateTimestamp ? (timestamp - lastUpdateTimestamp) * emissionsPerSecond : 0;
    }
```

## Impact
Voters may lose their rewards.

Considering the fee-on-transfer tokens, make sure actual received token amount can match our expected amount.
