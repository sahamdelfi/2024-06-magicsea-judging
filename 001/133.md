# Users will not receive the correct reward tokens when MlumStaking is Under-supplied

## Summary
The `_safeRewardTransfer()` function of the MlumStaking contract. When the contract is undersupplied with reward tokens, it can cause the `_harvestPosition()` function to send fewer tokens than needed or revert subsequent activities. This issue arises because the missing tokens are not accounted for, potentially leading to users not receiving the expected rewards. 

## Vulnerability Detail
All calculations are rounded down since a lack of reward tokens in the contracts cannot be attributed to rounding errors. Therefore, the rounding function is redundant.

If the contract is undersupplied with reward tokens, the [_harvestPosition()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/42e799446595c542eff9519353d3becc50cdba63/magicsea-staking/src/MlumStaking.sol#L674-L686) function will send fewer tokens than needed or revert all subsequent activities. This is particularly unsafe because the missing tokens are not accounted for. Consequently, a user who creates a staking position might invoke the `_safeRewardTransfer()` function and not receive the tokens they were supposed to.
```solidity
   function _safeRewardTransfer(address _to, uint256 _amount) internal {
        uint256 rewardBalance = rewardToken.balanceOf(address(this));

        if (_amount > rewardBalance) {
            _lastRewardBalance = _lastRewardBalance - rewardBalance;
            rewardToken.safeTransfer(_to, rewardBalance);
        } else {
            _lastRewardBalance = _lastRewardBalance - _amount;
            rewardToken.safeTransfer(_to, _amount);
        }
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To ensure that the `_safeRewardTransfer()` function only executes when there is a positive reward balance, add the following require statement:
```solidity
 require(rewardBalance > 0, "_safeRewardTransfer: balance is zero");
```
Alternatively, use the usual `safeTransfer` instead of `_safeRewardTransfer`.
