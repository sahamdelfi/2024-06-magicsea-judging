# Broken access control function _requireOnlyOperatorOrOwnerOf()

## Summary
The logic behind the access control function _requireOnlyOperatorOrOwnerOf() is flawed and will always return `true`.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `_requireOnlyOperatorOrOwnerOf()` function is used as an access control function, enforcing that only the owner or an authorized operator of the lock can call the function. But this function will always return `true` because `ERC721Upgradeable._isAuthorized()` function is being called using `msg.sender` as `owner` and `spender`. 

In the `_isAuthorized()` function logic, if `spender !=  0` and `owner == spender`, the function will return true.

## Impact
This access control function will always return `true`, failing to perform its intended functionality, which is to check if a userAddress has privileged rights. This can cause multiple problems, including regulatory issues and/or economic losses.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Call `_isAuthorized()` in the following way: `_isAuthorized(ownerOf(tokenId), msg.sender, tokenId)`
