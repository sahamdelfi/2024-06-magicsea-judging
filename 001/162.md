# Lock expiration is not properly validated in Voter#vote

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
https://docs.magicsea.finance/protocol/magic/magic-lum-voting#voting-1

>The overall lock needs to be longer then 90 days and the remaining lock period needs to be longer then the epoch time

```diff
        if (_mlumStaking.getStakingPosition(tokenId).initialLockDuration < _minimumLockTime) {
            revert IVoter__InsufficientLockTime();
        }
        if (_mlumStaking.getStakingPosition(tokenId).lockDuration < _periodDuration) {
            revert IVoter__InsufficientLockTime();
        }
```
In `Voter#vote`, remaining lock period is never checked, so it is possible to vote using a lock that is about to expire (or already expired), then create another lock and vote with it as well.

## Impact

Users are able to vote with a lock with remaining lock period shorter than epoch time, which should not be allowed according to docs.

Same funds can be used in two different locks to vote twice during the same voting epoch.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

`Voter#vote` should validate that `startLockTime + lockDuration <= period.endTime`.
