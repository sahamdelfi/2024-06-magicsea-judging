# The `vote` function does not work in case there is `BribeRewarder` assigned to the pool

## Summary

The `vote` function reverts when a `BribeRewarder` is assigned due to an incorrect ownership check in its `deposit` function. This check, intended for the `claim` function where users claim rewards, incorrectly verifies ownership when called by the `Voter` contract during voting.

## Vulnerability Detail

The [`vote`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/Voter.sol#L153-L219) function does not work when a `BribeRewarder` is assigned to the pool due to an incorrect check in the `BribeRewarder` contract. The [`deposit`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/Voter.sol#L225) function of `BribeRewarder` is called by the Voter while voting. The issue is that the `_modify` function [checks if the `msg.sender` is the owner of the `tokenId`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/rewarders/BribeRewarder.sol#L264-L266). This logic is correct for the `claim` function where the user claims rewards and is the owner of the `tokenId`, but not for the `deposit` function where the `msg.sender` is the `Voter` contract.

**Issue Scenario:**
1. There is a pool to vote for.
2. The `BribeRewarder` was added to provide bribes for the pool.
3. The user tries to vote for the pool.
4. The call always reverts because the Voter calls the deposit function of `BribeRewarder`, which triggers `_modify` to check if the msg.sender is the owner of tokenId.
5. This is incorrect since the `msg.sender` is the Voter contract in this context.

## Impact

It not possible to vote for any pools that have `BribeRewarder` assigned (core functionality of the protocol).

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to update the `deposit` logic to ensure it is possible to correctly vote for the pools.
