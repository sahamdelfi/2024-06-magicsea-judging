# Rewards can be stolen in MlumStaking.sol by frontrunning

## Summary
Rewards can be stolen in MlumStaking.sol by frontrunning

## Vulnerability Detail
MlumStaking receives rewardToken and distribute it among the stakers, who are staking.  An attacker can frontrun the rewardToken deposit to receive rewards and withdraw immediately after receiving rewards, successfully stealing other users reward
```solidity
 function createPosition(uint256 amount, uint256 lockDuration) external override nonReentrant {
        // no new lock can be set if the pool has been unlocked
        if (isUnlocked()) {
            require(lockDuration == 0, "locks disabled");
        }

        _updatePool();

        // handle tokens with transfer tax
        amount = _transferSupportingFeeOnTransfer(stakedToken, msg.sender, amount);
        require(amount != 0, "zero amount"); // createPosition: amount cannot be null

        // mint NFT position token
        uint256 currentTokenId = _mintNextTokenId(msg.sender);

        // calculate bonuses
        uint256 lockMultiplier = getMultiplierByLockDuration(lockDuration);
        uint256 amountWithMultiplier = amount * (lockMultiplier + 1e4) / 1e4;

        // create position
        _stakingPositions[currentTokenId] = StakingPosition({
            initialLockDuration: lockDuration,
            amount: amount,
            rewardDebt: amountWithMultiplier * (_accRewardsPerShare) / (PRECISION_FACTOR),
            lockDuration: lockDuration,
            startLockTime: _currentBlockTimestamp(),
            lockMultiplier: lockMultiplier,
            amountWithMultiplier: amountWithMultiplier,
            totalMultiplier: lockMultiplier
        });

        // update total lp supply
        _stakedSupply = _stakedSupply + amount;
        _stakedSupplyWithMultiplier = _stakedSupplyWithMultiplier + amountWithMultiplier;

        emit CreatePosition(currentTokenId, amount, lockDuration);
    }
```
```solidity
function withdrawFromPosition(uint256 tokenId, uint256 amountToWithdraw) external nonReentrant {
        _requireOnlyApprovedOrOwnerOf(tokenId);

        _updatePool();
        address nftOwner = ERC721Upgradeable.ownerOf(tokenId);
        _withdrawFromPosition(nftOwner, tokenId, amountToWithdraw);
    }
```

Attacker will create position that has 0 lock duration before the rewardToken deposit and due to 0 lock duration attacker will be able to withdraw immediately after staking along with rewards

All this happening due to `_accRewardsPerShare` which increases due to `increase` in rewardToken, so everytime there is rewardToken `deposited`, it increases the _accRewardsPerShare and an attacker can take advantage of that

## Impact
Rewards will be stolen

## Tool used
VS code

## Recommendation
Add some delay when a user creates position or use time based calculation
