# Voting should be suspended in case of emergency

## Summary

In case of emergency, users can release all their locked MLUMs right after voting. So, voting should not be allowed in case of emergency.

## Vulnerability Detail

In case of emergency, users can release all their locked MLUMs regardless of the remaining time.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/MlumStaking.sol#L624-L628
```solidity
        require(
            _unlockOperators.contains(nftOwner)
@>              || (position.startLockTime + position.lockDuration) <= _currentBlockTimestamp() || isUnlocked(),
            "locked"
        );
```

And, the comment for the MLUM voting says: 
```text
The overall lock needs to be longer then 90 days and the remaining lock period needs to be longer then the epoch time.
```

So, in case of emergency, the actual remaining time is 0, and users can release all their locked MLUMs right after voting.

Suppose the following scenario:

1. The `_emergencyUnlock` is set true.
2. Alice has two NFT positions, A and B.
3. A's voting power(amountWithMultiplier) is 100, and B's is 1.
4. Alice votes his voting power of position A.
5. Alice withdraws all his MLUMs locked in A, and add them to position B.
6. Alice votes his voting power of position B.

As a result, Alice's voting power becomes 100 + (100 + 1) = 201, which is higher than the actual voting power 100 + 1 = 101.
If Alice owned several positions, he could increase his voting power.(about (the actual voting power) * (the number of positions))

## Impact

In case of emergency, malicious users can take voting power much higher than the actual value.

## Recommendation

Voting should be suspended in case of emergency.

```diff

    function vote(uint256 tokenId, address[] calldata pools, uint256[] calldata deltaAmounts) external {
        [...]
+           if (_mlumStaking.isUnlocked()) revert("MlumStaking Emergency");   
        [...]
    }

```
