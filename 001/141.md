# When `isUnlocked`, the `addToPosition` function will set the position’s lockMultiplier to 0, but at the same time the lockDuration is greater than 0.

## Summary

When isUnlocked, the addToPosition function will set the position’s lockMultiplier to 0, but at the same time the lockDuration is greater than 0, which is unreasonable and noncorresponding..

## Vulnerability Detail

In the function `addToPosition`, user could add more tokens to position. The contract will recalculate the lock duration and update the lockMultiplier.

```solidity
uint256 avgDuration = (remainingLockTime * position.amount + amountToAdd * position.initialLockDuration)
    / (position.amount + amountToAdd);
    
position.startLockTime = _currentBlockTimestamp();
position.lockDuration = avgDuration;

// lock multiplier stays the same
position.lockMultiplier = getMultiplierByLockDuration(position.initialLockDuration);
```

However, this logic does not take into account the boundary case of `isUnlocked`. When isUnlocked, the function `getMultiplierByLockDuration` will return 0. But the position.lockDuration is still large than 0. This means that the user locks position for a period of time, but not receives a boost multiplier.

```solidity
function getMultiplierByLockDuration(uint256 lockDuration) public view returns (uint256) {
    // in case of emergency unlock
    if (isUnlocked()) return 0;

    if (_maxLockDuration == 0 || lockDuration == 0) return 0;

    // capped to maxLockDuration
    if (lockDuration >= _maxLockDuration) return _maxLockMultiplier;

    return (_maxLockMultiplier * lockDuration) / (_maxLockDuration);
}
```

## Impact

User locks his/her position for a period of time, but not receives a boost multiplier.

## Recommendation

When isUnlocked, the position.lockDuration and position.lockMultiplier should be 0 together.
