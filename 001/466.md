# If lock multiplier settings are changed even once, then it cannot be set to the original setting (*365 Days = 3x Multiplier*)

## Summary
According to docs: 
*"You can lock your Magic LUM into a NFT lock position to receive more rewards. You can lock up to 365 days. The lock boost multipliers are:
...
365 Days = 3x Multiplier"*

When initializing the contract, the max lock duration & multiplier are set as 365 days & 200% as stated.
The owner or operator can change the max duration anytime but the multiplier shouldn't exceed the upper multiplier limit.

The issue is that the upper limit `MAX_LOCK_MULTIPLIER_LIMIT` is set to a value of `150%`. If the owner tries to change the multiplier **again** to the original value, the function would revert.

## Vulnerability Detail

The hardcoded upper limit of the multiplier:
```solidity
File: MlumStaking.sol

69:        uint256 public constant MAX_LOCK_MULTIPLIER_LIMIT = 15000; // 150%, high limit for maxLockMultiplier (100 = 1%)
```

```solidity
File: MlumStaking.sol

      function setLockMultiplierSettings(uint256 maxLockDuration, uint256 maxLockMultiplier) external {
        require(msg.sender == owner() || msg.sender == _operator, "FORBIDDEN");
        // onlyOperatorOrOwner: caller has no operator rights
        require(maxLockMultiplier <= MAX_LOCK_MULTIPLIER_LIMIT, "too high");     // @note - cannot be changed back to 200% once changed
        // setLockSettings: maxGlobalMultiplier is too high
        _maxLockDuration = maxLockDuration;
        _maxLockMultiplier = maxLockMultiplier;

        emit SetLockMultiplierSettings(maxLockDuration, maxLockMultiplier);
    }
```
- Operator calls `setLockMultiplierSettings()` to change the multiplier to 150% for 365 days.
- After some days the owner decides to set the multiplier to the original 200%.
- The function would revert because the multiplier cannot be set greater than 150% as per the check.

## Impact
Multiplier cannot be set back to a **3x** multiplier once changed.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Increase the `MAX_LOCK_MULTIPLIER_LIMIT` to `20000` (200%) so that the multiplier can be changed backed to the original once changed.

```solidity
File: MlumStaking.sol

- 69:        uint256 public constant MAX_LOCK_MULTIPLIER_LIMIT = 15000; // 150%, high limit for maxLockMultiplier (100 = 1%)
+ 69:        uint256 public constant MAX_LOCK_MULTIPLIER_LIMIT = 20000; // 200%, high limit for maxLockMultiplier (100 = 1%)
```
