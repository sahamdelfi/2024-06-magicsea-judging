# DoS of bribes for any pool for any period via dust bribes

## Summary

Bribes for any pool for any period can be DoSed via dust bribes because of the 5 bribes limit.

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
    function onRegister() external override {
        IBribeRewarder rewarder = IBribeRewarder(msg.sender);
        _checkRegisterCaller(rewarder);

        uint256 currentPeriodId = _currentVotingPeriodId;
        (address pool, uint256[] memory periods) = rewarder.getBribePeriods();
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < periods.length; ++i) {
            require(periods[i] >= currentPeriodId, "wrong period");
            require(_bribesPerPriod[periods[i]][pool].length + 1 <= Constants.MAX_BRIBES_PER_POOL, "too much bribes");
            _bribesPerPriod[periods[i]][pool].push(rewarder);
        }
    }
```

Voter#onRegister is called whenever a new bribe is created via `fundAndBribe` or `bribe`.

As deploying BribeRewarders and creating bribes is permissionless, anyone can create 5 dust bribes for any pool for any period, and prevent legitimate users from creating bribes for the pool for these periods.

## Impact

Attacker can disable bribes for any pool for any period via dust bribes.

## Recommendation

Sort bribes by size and unregister the smallest BribeRewarder (and allow withdrawals for its owner) every time a bigger BribeRewarder is registered and the limit is reached.

Or introduce a minimal size for bribes, which should be big enough to discourage the attack, but small enough to not prevent legitimate bribes.
