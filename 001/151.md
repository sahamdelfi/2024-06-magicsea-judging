# Positions with expired locks can still vote and earn rewards

## Summary
Positions with expired votes can still vote and earn rewards.
## Vulnerability Detail
The documentation states the following:
`Re-New Lock:
You can renew your lock position to the initial lock amount. This function is important to be able to renew your existing position if the remaining lock time is not enough for voting anymore.`(extracted from https://docs.magicsea.finance/protocol/magic/magic-lum-staking#bribes-1 and also https://docs.magicsea.finance/protocol/magic/magic-lum-voting#voting-1)
This means that users with expired locks will not be able to vote anymore. However in the vote function there is no such thing.
POC:
In the Voter.t.sol I rewrote the testVoteGetters test so that Alice lock is now expired. However she was still able to vote
```solidity
 function testVoteGetters() public {
        _createPosition(ALICE);
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 4 weeks);

        vm.prank(DEV);
        _voter.startNewVotingPeriod();

        //_defaultVoteOnce(ALICE, true);
        vm.startPrank(ALICE);
        _voter.vote(1, _getDummyPools(), _getDeltaAmounts());
        address pool = _getDummyPools()[0];

        assertEq(1e18, _voter.getTotalVotes());
        assertEq(1e18, _voter.getUserVotes(1, pool));
        assertEq(1e18, _voter.getPoolVotesPerPeriod(1, pool));
        assertEq(0, _voter.getPoolVotesPerPeriod(2, pool));
        assertEq(1e18, _voter.getPoolVotes(pool));
    }
```
## Impact
Users with expired lock can still vote and earn rewards which is unwanted behaviour per documentation.

## Recommendation
Check if lock is expired before allowing users to vote.
