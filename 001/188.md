# Average lockDuration calculation in addToPosition ignores transfer fee deduction

## Summary
The `addToPosition` function in the **MlumStaking** contract calculates the `average lock duration` using the initial `amountToAdd`, which does not account for transfer fees in the case of `Fee-on-transfer` tokens. This discrepancy leads to incorrect lock duration calculations.

## Vulnerability Detail
The average lock duration is calculated in the addToPosition function [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/MlumStaking.sol#L410) using the formula:
```solidity
uint256 avgDuration = (remainingLockTime * position.amount + amountToAdd * position.initialLockDuration)
            / (position.amount + amountToAdd);
``` 
            
In this formula, amountToAdd is used directly before deducting fees for tokens with a transfer tax, leading to an incorrect and inflated calculation of lockDuration.

## Impact
The lock duration is inaccurately calculated, resulting in longer lock periods than intended. This can mislead users about the actual lock duration of their staked tokens, potentially affecting their staking strategies and reward expectations.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Update the average lock duration calculation to use the actual amount added after transfer fee deduction.
```solidity
// handle tokens with transfer tax
amountToAdd = _transferSupportingFeeOnTransfer(stakedToken, msg.sender, amountToAdd);
        
uint256 avgDuration = (remainingLockTime * position.amount + amountToAdd * position.initialLockDuration)
            / (position.amount + amountToAdd);
```
