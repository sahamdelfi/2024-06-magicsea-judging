# `BribeRewarder.deposit` Will Always Revert, Blocking the Voting Mechanism

## Summary
The `BribeRewarder.deposit` function will always revert when called by the Voter contract due to an incorrect token ownership check. This will lead to a Denial of Service (DOS) of the voting mechanism and subsequently block any rewards distribution.

## Vulnerability Detail
Once a user stakes MLUM tokens, they receive an ERC721 token representing their staking position. This token allows them to vote by calling the `Voter.vote` function and providing the list of pools they want to vote on and their associated vote amounts.

The `Voter.vote` function, upon recording the user's vote, calls `_notifyBribes` to inform the `BribeRewarder` that the user has indeed voted on that specific pool. This makes the user eligible for additional reward distribution.

The issue arises at this step because `_notifyBribes` will invoke the `BribeRewarder.deposit` function to record the user's participation:

```solidity
function deposit(uint256 periodId, uint256 tokenId, uint256 deltaAmount) public onlyVoter {
    _modify(periodId, tokenId, deltaAmount.toInt256(), false);

    emit Deposited(periodId, tokenId, _pool(), deltaAmount);
}
```

As seen, this function calls `BribeRewarder._modify`, which contains a check to ensure that its caller (`msg.sender`) is always the ERC721 token owner, as highlighted below:

```solidity
function _modify(uint256 periodId, uint256 tokenId, int256 deltaAmount, bool isPayOutReward)
    private
    returns (uint256 rewardAmount)
{   
    //@audit will revert on deposit as msg.sender == Voter 
    if (!IVoter(_caller).ownerOf(tokenId, msg.sender)) {
        revert BribeRewarder__NotOwner();
    }

    ...
}
```

```solidity
function ownerOf(uint256 tokenId, address account) external view returns (bool) {
    return _mlumStaking.ownerOf(tokenId) == account;
}
```

This will cause the Voter's call to `BribeRewarder.deposit` to always revert because the function caller (`msg.sender == address(Voter)`) is not the real token owner. This will effectively DOS the voting mechanism for any pool that has implemented external bribes with `BribeRewarder`.

This issue will subsequently block all rewards distribution associated with pools that use external bribes (`BribeRewarder`).

Additionally, because the `BribeRewarder.deposit` function is only callable by the Voter contract (presence of the `onlyVoter` modifier), which is not the real token owner of the ERC721 tokens used during voting, the function will always revert and can never be called.

## Impact
Complete DOS of the voting mechanism for pools that use `BribeRewarder` to include bribe rewards.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To address this issue, update the `BribeRewarder._modify` function to check that the original voter account (which called `Voter.vote` in the first place) is the real token owner. This can be done by checking the `tx.origin` address as follows (note that this change does not impact the claiming process):

```diff
function _modify(uint256 periodId, uint256 tokenId, int256 deltaAmount, bool isPayOutReward)
    private
    returns (uint256 rewardAmount)
{   
--  if (!IVoter(_caller).ownerOf(tokenId, msg.sender)) {
++  if (!IVoter(_caller).ownerOf(tokenId, tx.origin)) {
        revert BribeRewarder__NotOwner();
    }

    // extra check so we don't calculate rewards before start time
    (uint256 startTime,) = IVoter(_caller).getPeriodStartEndtime(periodId);
    if (block.timestamp <= startTime) {
        _lastUpdateTimestamp = startTime;
    }

    RewardPerPeriod storage reward = _rewards[_indexByPeriodId(periodId)];
    Amounts.Parameter storage amounts = reward.userVotes;
    Rewarder2.Parameter storage rewarder = reward.rewarder;

    (uint256 oldBalance, uint256 newBalance, uint256 oldTotalSupply,) = amounts.update(tokenId, deltaAmount);

    uint256 totalRewards = _calculateRewards(periodId);

    rewardAmount = rewarder.update(bytes32(tokenId), oldBalance, newBalance, oldTotalSupply, totalRewards);

    if (block.timestamp > _lastUpdateTimestamp) {
        _lastUpdateTimestamp = block.timestamp;
    }

    if (isPayOutReward) {
        rewardAmount = rewardAmount + unclaimedRewards[periodId][tokenId];
        unclaimedRewards[periodId][tokenId] = 0;
        if (rewardAmount > 0) {
            IERC20 token = _token();
            _safeTransferTo(token, msg.sender, rewardAmount);
        }
    } else {
        unclaimedRewards[periodId][tokenId] += rewardAmount;
    }
}
```
