# Everybody is able to call `MlumStaking::addToPosition ` for any tokenId

## Summary
Everybody is able to call addToPosition for any tokenId, due to bad msg.sender validation

## Vulnerability Detail
As we can see from the comments above `MlumStaking::addToPosition ` `Can only be called by lsNFT's owner or operators` 
```solidity
/** 
      * @dev Add to an existing staking position 
      * 
      * Can only be called by lsNFT's owner or operators 
      */ 
     function addToPosition(uint256 tokenId, uint256 amountToAdd) external override nonReentrant { 
         _requireOnlyOperatorOrOwnerOf(tokenId); 
    .....
```
However, the only msg.sender validation is provided by `MlumStaking::_requireOnlyOperatorOrOwnerOf `
```solidity
function _requireOnlyOperatorOrOwnerOf(uint256 tokenId) internal view { 
     // isApprovedOrOwner: caller has no rights on token 
     require(ERC721Upgradeable._isAuthorized(msg.sender, msg.sender, tokenId), "FORBIDDEN"); 
 } 
```
```solidity
function _isAuthorized(address owner, address spender, uint256 tokenId) internal view virtual returns (bool) {
        return
            spender != address(0) &&
            (owner == spender || isApprovedForAll(owner, spender) || _getApproved(tokenId) == spender);
    }
```
As we can see from the inputs, this check will always pass, due to owner == spender(msg.sender == msg.sender), no matter if msg.sender is owner/approved or not

## Impact
1. Broke invariant, msg.sender doesn't need to be owner of tokenId or operator
2. User who tires to withdraw his funds could be front-runned with `MulmStaking::addToPosition` and fail withdrawing, due position still locked

## Recommendation
```diff
function _requireOnlyOperatorOrOwnerOf(uint256 tokenId) internal view {
        // isApprovedOrOwner: caller has no rights on token
---        require(ERC721Upgradeable._isAuthorized(msg.sender, msg.sender, tokenId), "FORBIDDEN");
+++        require(ERC721Upgradeable._isAuthorized(_ownerOf(tokenId), msg.sender, tokenId), "FORBIDDEN");
    }
```
