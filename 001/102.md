# reverts in `Voter.vote()` due to wrong check in `BribeRewarder._modify()` [DOS]

## Summary


## Vulnerability Detail
Ownership of tokenID won't be transferred to Voter.sol during `vote()` so the below check in `BribeRewarder._modify()` is wrong because voter.sol is going to be msg.sender and voter.sol isn't tokenID owner.

```solidity
    function _modify(uint256 periodId, uint256 tokenId, int256 deltaAmount, bool isPayOutReward)
        private
        returns (uint256 rewardAmount)
    {
        if (!IVoter(_caller).ownerOf(tokenId, msg.sender)) {
            revert BribeRewarder__NotOwner();
        }
```

`_modify()` is used by `BribeRewarder.deposit()` which is called in `_notifyBribes()` 

`Voter.vote()` will always revert  `BribeRewarder__NotOwner()` because of the wrong check.

## Impact
reverts in `Voter.vote()` due to wrong check in `BribeRewarder._modify()`

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

pass the msg.sender that calls `Voter.vote()` as a param into `BribeRewarder.deposit()` and then into `BribeRewarder._modify()` and use it for the check 
```solidity
 if (!IVoter(_caller).ownerOf(tokenId, voter#vote_caller)) {
            revert BribeRewarder__NotOwner();
        }
```
