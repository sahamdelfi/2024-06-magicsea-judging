# BribeRewarder doesn't check whether current supply is zero resulting in some portion of rewards being lost

## Summary
`BribeRewarder::_modify` function first calculates total collected rewards since `_lastUpdateTimestamp` and then updates `accDebtPerShare` using total rewards and total supply (total votes).
since total supply is zero on the first vote, `accDebtPerShare` remains at  0 and since `_lastUpdateTimestamp` is updated to current timestamp, this portion of rewards will be lost forever in the contract without being distributed.

## Vulnerability Detail
coded PoC to demonstrate better:
https://gist.github.com/CDDose/a10491477e53d93acfd80aed34f1c952
`BribeRewarder::_calculateRewards` calculates collected rewards since last update timestamp:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/rewarders/BribeRewarder.sol#L300-L313
```solidity
    function _calculateRewards(uint256 periodId) internal view returns (uint256) {
        (uint256 startTime, uint256 endTime) = IVoter(_caller).getPeriodStartEndtime(periodId);
        if (endTime == 0 || startTime > block.timestamp) {
            return 0;
        }
        uint256 duration = endTime - startTime;
        uint256 emissionsPerSecond = _amountPerPeriod / duration;
        uint256 lastUpdateTimestamp = _lastUpdateTimestamp;
        uint256 timestamp = block.timestamp > endTime ? endTime : block.timestamp;
        //@audit calculate total rewards since lastUpdateTimeStamp
        return timestamp > lastUpdateTimestamp ? (timestamp - lastUpdateTimestamp) * emissionsPerSecond : 0;
    }
```
and then updates `accDebtPerShare`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/rewarders/BribeRewarder.sol#L282
```solidity
    function _modify(uint256 periodId, uint256 tokenId, int256 deltaAmount, bool isPayOutReward)
        private
        returns (uint256 rewardAmount)
    {
         //... 
         //@audit total rewards collected since last update time
        uint256 totalRewards = _calculateRewards(periodId);
        //@audit update accDebtPerShare
        rewardAmount = rewarder.update(bytes32(tokenId), oldBalance, newBalance, oldTotalSupply, totalRewards);
        //...
    }
```
from `Rewader2::update` we know that if current supply or total rewards are zero, `accDebtPerShare` does not change, since total supply is zero on the first vote,`accDebtPerShare` doesn't change  (remains 0):
`Rewarder2::getDebtPerShare:`
```solidity
    function getDebtPerShare(
        uint256 totalDeposit,
        uint256 totalRewards
    ) internal pure returns (uint256) {
        return
            //@audit if totalDeposit is zero, return 0
            totalDeposit == 0
                ? 0
                : (totalRewards << Constants.ACC_PRECISION_BITS) / totalDeposit;
    }
```
then `_lastUpdateTimestamp` is updated to current `block.timestamp` without checking whether `oldTotalSupply` is zero or not:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/rewarders/BribeRewarder.sol#L284-L286
```solidity
        if (block.timestamp > _lastUpdateTimestamp) {
            _lastUpdateTimestamp = block.timestamp;
        }
```
normally, it would be something like this to avoid wasting rewards when there is no supply, because if we set `_lastUpdateTimestamp` to current timestamp `_calculateRewards` returns zero on the next call meaning that all previous rewards were wasted:
```solidity
        if (block.timestamp > _lastUpdateTimestamp && oldSupply > 0) {
            _lastUpdateTimestamp = block.timestamp;
        }
```
## Impact
_The amount of reward tokens being lost is proportional to the delay from start of voting epoch untill first vote._
**Example:**
Assume that there is an unpopular pool which no one votes for (which can happen most probably) and it has a rewarder giving away USDC for all the voters in current epoch. (1000 USDC total rewards)
The voting epoch starts with a duration of 14 days, since this pool is unpopular, the first vote is submitted 4 days after epoch started. in this case, 4/14 or 30% of rewards are distributed, but since `oldTotalSupply` is zero, `accDebtPerShare` remains zero, additionally since `_lastUpdateTimestamp` is updated to current timestamp, 30% of rewards (333 USDC) got lost without being distributed.
**_Also its worth mentioning that this rewards are locked in the contract forever, since there is no way to withdraw them or add them to rewards of other epochs (`BribeRewarder` can only be initialized one time)_**

## Recommendation
Do not update `_lastUpdateTimestamp` if `accDebtPerShare` is not changed.
