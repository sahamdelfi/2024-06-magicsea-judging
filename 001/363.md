# Use of fee on transfer tokens will result in wrong calculation of `avgDuration` in `MlumStaking::addToPosition`

## Summary
As per sponsor, the MlumStaking contract might be used in future to stake tokens other than MLUM. If the staking token is a fee on transfer token, the lock period in `MulumStaking::addToPosition` will be calculated incorrectly.  

## Vulnerability Detail
```js
File: MlumStaking.sol

410:    uint256 avgDuration = (remainingLockTime * position.amount + amountToAdd * position.initialLockDuration)
411:        / (position.amount + amountToAdd);
        ...
420:    amountToAdd = _transferSupportingFeeOnTransfer(stakedToken, msg.sender, amountToAdd);
```
The `amountToAdd` used in calculating `avgDuration` is not the actual amount the contract receives due to the associated fee, which can lead to longer lock period than intended.

## Impact
The tokens will be locked for a longer time.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Calculate `avgDuration` after a call to `_transferSupportingFeeOnTransfer`.

```diff
+  amountToAdd = _transferSupportingFeeOnTransfer(stakedToken, msg.sender, amountToAdd);

   uint256 avgDuration = (remainingLockTime * position.amount + amountToAdd * position.initialLockDuration)
        / (position.amount + amountToAdd);
        ...
-  amountToAdd = _transferSupportingFeeOnTransfer(stakedToken, msg.sender, amountToAdd);

```
