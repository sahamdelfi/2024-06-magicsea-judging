# Voting Malfunction Leading to Core Protocol Vulnerability

## Summary
Function `Voter:vote` is responsible to vote for a particular pool, only stakers of `Mlum` in  `MlumStaking.sol` can call this function, While there is a check which is stopping to execute whole vote function and impacting the core functionality of the protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail
When the staker Of `Mlum` will call `vote` function with the parameters 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/Voter.sol#L153-L156
All check will passed and execution will proceed to `_notifyBribes`
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/Voter.sol#L211
If we look at the execution of this function
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/Voter.sol#L221-L229
For each rewarder it will call the deposit function of that rewarder contract, and the rewarder here is `BribeRewarder`
If we look at `BribeRewarder:deposit`  function 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/rewarders/BribeRewarder.sol#L143-L147
It has a modifier `onlyVoter ` which checks if the called is the `voter` contract or not, so this will pass as the msg.sender is the voter contract.
Then it calls `_modify` function ,if we look at that function
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/rewarders/BribeRewarder.sol#L260-L267
In starting of the execution of the function there is a check, which checks if the owner of the tokenId(The staking position's tokenId ) 
is `msg.sender` or not, if not then it reverts and will halt full execution of vote function. So as `msg.sender` is the `Voter` so this will get failed.
## Impact
The voting will not work breaking the core functionality of the function.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Remove the check in _modify for the owner of the tokenId as it has been already verified in the `voter.sol`, and add a check in function `claim` to verify it the `msg.sender` is the owner of tokenId.
