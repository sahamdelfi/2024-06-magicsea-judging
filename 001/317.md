# Bribe rewards are lost if a pool receives no votes during an epoch

## Summary

Bribe rewards for an epoch are lost if a pool receives no votes during that epoch.

## Vulnerability Detail

To encourage voting for a pool, anyone can set up bribes for the pool's farm, creating incentives to vote for the pool and strengthen it (e.g. a protocol may want to incentivize its own pool by bribing its voters with tokens).

Each voting epoch has an associated bribe rewards, and those rewards are distributed in a Masterchef-staking manner, where the rewards are distributed pro-rata to the number of votes put into that pool for the epoch.

However if the pool still does not receive any votes at all for the period, the bribe reward admin has no way to withdraw rewards. Thus, those bribe reward tokens remain stuck in the contract.

## Impact

Bribe rewards for an epoch are lost with no way to recover if there are no voters.

## Recommendation

Allow admin-withdrawing of rewards for an epoch if the epoch has fully passed, and the bribed pool receives no votes for the period.
