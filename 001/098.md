# The limitation of bribing for the pool leads to denial of service condition

## Summary

The limit of five bribers per pool can cause a denial of service, preventing legitimate bribers from providing rewards if periods are already saturated by other bribers.

## Vulnerability Detail

The limitation of bribing for the pool to a maximum of five bribers leads to a denial of service condition. Legitimate bribers who wish to provide rewards might be prevented from doing so if the given periods are saturated by other bribers.

**Issue Scenario:**
1. Five bribers provide rewards for period 5.
2. A new briber wants to start providing bribes for periods 1-20.
3. The briber cannot do this because the logic will iterate over all periods and revert at period 5 since it is already saturated.

## Impact

A legitimate briber cannot provide bribes in the form of rewards for the specified periods.

## Recommendation

It is recommended to redesign the logic so that bribers can add bribe rewards without being affected by other bribers.
