# Bribe rewards are not always distributed relative to the  voting power allocated by users

## Summary
The ``BribeRewarder.sol`` contract can be used to incentivize users to vote for a specific pool. Once a ``BribeRewarder.sol`` instance has been associated with a pool there is a specified amount of rewards which will be distributed to users for each voting period. However the logic in the ``BribeRewarder.sol`` contract takes into account the time at which a user voted for a certain pool during a voting period. Once a user has voted for a voting period he can't reallocate his voting power to another pool during the same voting period. The weight which is assigned to each pool at the end of a voting period is proportional to the amount of votes the specific pool received compared to all other pools, it doesn't matter when users voted for that pool. But as previously mentioned reward calculations in the ``BribeRewarder.sol`` contract take into account the time at which users voted, so if a user votes in the beginning with a small amount of votes there is a high chance he will receive more rewards than a user who votes with a much bigger voting power but near  the end of the voting period. Users who vote early with small voting power are effectively stealing rewards from users who supply bigger voting power to a pool, at a later time. Well known and battle tested bribing implementations protocol distribute rewards based on the user supplied votes exactly due to the above described scenario. For example the [Votium](https://docs.votium.app/explainers/voter-manual) app states the following *The share of the incentive you receive will be relative to the % of the voting power you allocated to the pool*.

After following the steps in the above mentioned [gist](https://gist.github.com/AtanasDimulski/bc8b548900acaabaf8ccfd373a783679) add the following test to the ``AuditorTests.t.sol`` file
```solidity
    function test_RewardsNotDistributedRelativeToVotingPower() public {
        uint256 lockDuration = 365 days;
        mintMlumPosition(alice, 10_000e18, lockDuration);
        mintMlumPosition(bob, 1e18, lockDuration);

        vm.startPrank(tom);
        BribeRewarder rewarder;
        rewarder = BribeRewarder(payable(address(rewarderFactory.createBribeRewarder(bribeRewardToken, pool))));
        bribeRewardToken.mint(tom, 10_000e6);
        bribeRewardToken.approve(address(rewarder), type(uint256).max);
        rewarder.fundAndBribe(1, 1, 10_00e6);
        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.startPrank(owner);
        ///@notice set period durtation to 1000 seconds
        voter.updatePeriodDuration(1000);
        voter.startNewVotingPeriod();
        console2.log("Current block timestamp: ", block.timestamp);
        (uint256 periodStartTime, uint256 periodEndTime) = voter.getPeriodStartEndtime(1);
        console2.log("Period 1 start time: ", periodStartTime);
        console2.log("Period 1 end time: ", periodEndTime);
        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.startPrank(bob);
        console2.log("Block timestamp before alice deposit: ", block.timestamp);

        pools[0] = pool;
        ///@notice bob deposits only 1e18 of his voting power, at the beggining of the voting period
        deltaAmounts[0] = 1e18;
        voter.vote(2, pools, deltaAmounts);
        vm.stopPrank();
        
        skip(950);
        vm.startPrank(alice);
        console2.log("Block timestamp before alice deposit: ", block.timestamp);
        IMlumStaking.StakingPosition memory mlumPositionAlice;
        mlumPositionAlice = mlumStaking.getStakingPosition(1);
        uint256[] memory deltaAmountsAlice = new uint256[](1);
        ///@notice alice deposits all of her voting power, which is way bigger than bob's but near the end of the voting period
        deltaAmountsAlice[0] = mlumPositionAlice.amountWithMultiplier;
        voter.vote(1, pools, deltaAmountsAlice);
        console2.log("Total voting power for a pool: ", voter.getVotesPerPeriod(1,pool));
        console2.log("Total voting power for a pool normalized: ", voter.getVotesPerPeriod(1,pool) / 1e18);

        console2.log("Voting power for a pool coming from bob normalized: ", voter.getUserVotes(2, pool) / 1e18);
        console2.log("Voting power for a pool coming from alice: ", voter.getUserVotes(1, pool));
        console2.log("Voting power for a pool coming from alice normalized: ", voter.getUserVotes(1, pool) / 1e18);
        vm.stopPrank();

        ///@notice the voting period ends
        skip(100);

        vm.startPrank(bob);
        rewarder.claim(2);
        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.startPrank(alice);
        rewarder.claim(1);
        console2.log("Bob balance of briber reward token after he claims his rewards: ", bribeRewardToken.balanceOf(bob));
        console2.log("Alice balance of briber reward token after she claims her rewards: ", bribeRewardToken.balanceOf(alice));
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```

```solidity
Logs:
  Current block timestamp:  1
  Period 1 start time:  1
  Period 1 end time:  1001
  Block timestamp before alice deposit:  1

  Block timestamp before alice deposit:  951
  Total rewards from BribeRewarder.sol:  950000000

  Alice balance of briber reward token after she claims her rewards:  49997441
```
As can be seen from the above logs alice supplies **30_000e18** of the voting power, while bob supplies **1e18**, however bob receives much more rewards than alice **≈950e6** and **≈50e6** respectively. Bob receives almost **95%** of all rewards because he just voted earlier, despite the fact that alice supplied **30_000** times more votes for the given pool.
 
To run the test use: ``forge test -vvv --mt test_RewardsNotDistributedRelativeToVotingPower``
## Impact
Rewards in the ``BribeRewarder.sol`` contract are distributed based on voting power and time at which the user voted. However the weight of a pool in only decided based on the actual votes that voted for it. Users who vote for a pool with smaller voting power in the beginning of the voting period can receive much more rewards than users who voted with a lot of voting power but near the end of the voting period as described above. This is effectively stealing rewards, from people who supply much more voting power.

## Tool used
Manual Review & Foundry

## Recommendation
For each voting period distribute rewards once the period is over and only take into account the proportion of votes each user voted with, not the time at which he voted.
