# Malicious user can `DoS` honest BribeRewarder by `creating` MAX_BRIBES_PER_POOL with very `small` amount

## Summary
Malicious user can `DoS` honest BribeRewarder by `creating` MAX_BRIBES_PER_POOL with very `small` amount

## Vulnerability Detail
Voter.sol allow any user to create/register bribeRewarder for any pool and max bribe that can be created per votingPeriod per pool is 5 ie MAX_BRIBES_PER_POOL
```solidity
 uint256 internal constant MAX_BRIBES_PER_POOL = 5;
```
```solidity
function onRegister() external override {
...
        (address pool, uint256[] memory periods) = rewarder.getBribePeriods();
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < periods.length; ++i) {
            // TODO check if rewarder token + pool  is already registered

            require(periods[i] >= currentPeriodId, "wrong period");
       @>   require(_bribesPerPriod[periods[i]][pool].length + 1 <= Constants.MAX_BRIBES_PER_POOL, "too much bribes");
            _bribesPerPriod[periods[i]][pool].push(rewarder);
        }
    }
```
A malicious user can take advantage of this MAX_BRIBES_PER_POOL to create multiple(5) bribeRewarder for multiple votingPeriod for a specific pool which he wants to DoS with very little amount(amountPerPeriod)

//How this works:
1. Suppose an honest user wanted to bribe for `poolA` to pass the minVotes or to attract voters
2. Malicious user saw this and `created` 5 bibeRewarder for the same poolA & bribe it from `currentVotingPeriod` to till he wants to DoS with `amountPerPeriod = 1 wei`
3. This will `register` the all 5 bribeRewarder to voter.sol contract( in _bribesPerPriod mapping)
4. When honest user will try to register the real bribeRewarder, it will `revert` due to MAX_BRIBES_PER_POOL( see above code )

Note: All this can be done with very little amount ie as little as 5 wei( 5 bibeRewarder * 1 wei )

## Impact
Honest pool can be DoSed with very little amount

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
There are couple of ways:
1. Set min amountPerPeriod in BribeRewarder that is required while bribing 
2. Charge min fee when a user register for BribeRewarder in Voter.sol
