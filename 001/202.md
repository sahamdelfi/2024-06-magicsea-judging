# MlumStaking.sol#_requireOnlyOperatorOrOwnerOf is improperly implemented

## Summary
The `_requireOnlyOperatorOrOwnerOf` function is improperly implemented returning always true.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `_requireOnlyOperatorOrOwnerOf` function should ensure that the `msg.sender` is either the owner of the tokenId or an approved spender. If the `msg.sender` does not meet these criteria, they should not be able to use the token.

Currently, `_requireOnlyOperatorOrOwnerOf` calls the `_isAuthorized` function but incorrectly passes `msg.sender` as the owner, making the `owner == spender` check always evaluates to true. 
```js
    function _requireOnlyOperatorOrOwnerOf(uint256 tokenId) internal view {
        // isApprovedOrOwner: caller has no rights on token
        require(ERC721Upgradeable._isAuthorized(msg.sender, msg.sender, tokenId), "FORBIDDEN");
    }

```
As we can see there is a WARNING comment that states `This function assumes that owner is the actual owner of tokenId and does not verify this assumption.`  So, the tokenId owner should be passed to the `_isAuthorized` not the `msg.sender`.
```js
/**
     * @dev Returns whether `spender` is allowed to manage `owner`'s tokens, or `tokenId` in
     * particular (ignoring whether it is owned by `owner`).
     *
     * WARNING: This function assumes that `owner` is the actual owner of `tokenId` and does not verify this
     * assumption.
     */
   function _isAuthorized(address owner, address spender, uint256 tokenId) internal view virtual returns (bool) {
        return
            spender != address(0) &&
            (owner == spender || isApprovedForAll(owner, spender) || _getApproved(tokenId) == spender);
    }

```
## Impact
Anyone can add to someone else position although they are not approved by the owner.

## Recommendation
```diff
    function _requireOnlyOperatorOrOwnerOf(uint256 tokenId) internal view {
        // isApprovedOrOwner: caller has no rights on token
-        require(ERC721Upgradeable._isAuthorized(msg.sender, msg.sender, tokenId), "FORBIDDEN");
+        require(ERC721Upgradeable._isAuthorized(_ownerOf(tokenId), msg.sender, tokenId), "FORBIDDEN");

    }
