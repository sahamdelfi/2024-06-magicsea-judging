# Loss of precision in BribeRewarder for reward emission

## Summary

The [`_calculateRewards`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/rewarders/BribeRewarder.sol#L300-L313) function leads to a loss of precision and accumulation of dust rewards not distributed to voters. This issue arises from calculating `emissionsPerSecond` as `_amountPerPeriod` divided by `duration`, resulting in imprecise reward calculations in the final calculations.

## Vulnerability Detail

The reward calculations in the [`_calculateRewards`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/rewarders/BribeRewarder.sol#L300-L313) function lead to a loss of precision and accumulation of dust rewards that are not distributed to voters. The function calculates [ `emissionsPerSecond`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/rewarders/BribeRewarder.sol#L308) as `_amountPerPeriod` divided by `duration`. This value is then [used](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/rewarders/BribeRewarder.sol#L312) in reward calculations, resulting in a loss of precision.

Proof of Concept
```solidity
    function test_precision() public {
        setStartTimeEndTime(86400 * 14);

        address pool = address(0x234);
        BribeRewarder bribeRewarder = BribeRewarder(payable(address(factory.createBribeRewarder(bribeToken, pool))));

        bribeToken.mint(address(this), 200e18);
        bribeToken.approve(address(bribeRewarder), 200e18);
        bribeRewarder.fundAndBribe(1, 10, 20e18);

        // create position mlum
        stakedToken.mint(address(this), 200e18);
        stakedToken.approve(address(mlumStaking), 200e18);
        mlumStaking.createPosition(200e18, 86400 * 20);

        // deposit
        uint256 tokenId = 1;
        vm.warp(block.timestamp);
        bribeRewarder.deposit(1, tokenId, 10e18);
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + (86401 * 20));
        bribeRewarder.claim(tokenId);

        uint256 rewards = bribeRewarder.unclaimedRewards(1, tokenId);
        console.log(rewards);
    }
```
Results:
```shell
Ran 1 test for test/PwnBribeRewarder.t.sol:PwnBribeRewarder
[PASS] test_precision() (gas: 1042198)
Logs:
  19999999999999353599
```

Not all rewards were distributed, the remaining are left and locked out in the contract.
Once the calculation of rewards is changed as recommended in recommendation section the proof of concept returns:
```shell
Ran 1 test for test/PwnBribeRewader.t.sol:PwnBribeRewarder
[PASS] test_precision() (gas: 1042364)
Logs:
  20000000000000000000
```
All rewards were successfully distributed.

## Impact

Not all rewards are being distributed and they are being stuck within the `BribeRewarder` contract.
This issue is becoming very serious for the tokens with low number of decimals and high value, such as WBTC.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to remove `emissionsPerSecond ` and update the final calculation:
```solidity
return timestamp > lastUpdateTimestamp ? (timestamp - lastUpdateTimestamp) * emissionsPerSecond : 0;
```
to
```solidity
return timestamp > lastUpdateTimestamp ? (timestamp - lastUpdateTimestamp) * _amountPerPeriod / duration : 0;
```
