# Precision loss due to divison before multiplication in `BribeRewarder::_calculateRewards`

# Precision loss due to divison before multiplication in `BribeRewarder::_calculateRewards`
## Summary
In the `BribeRewarder::_calculateRewards` function, performing division before multiplication results in a loss of precision, leading to users receiving slightly less rewards than intended.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `_calculateRewards` function within the BribeRewarder contract is responsible for calculating the rewards users should receive based on various parameters such as the `period ID`, `start time`, `end time`, and the `amount per period`. This function plays a critical role in ensuring fair distribution of rewards among users.

However, a subtle vulnerability exists within this function related to the order of arithmetic operations, specifically division before multiplication. Solidity, the programming language used for Ethereum smart contracts, does not support floating-point numbers. As a result, when performing division before multiplication, precision loss occurs because the division operation truncates towards zero, discarding any fractional part. This truncation leads to an underestimation of the emissionsPerSecond value, which subsequently affects the total reward calculation.

```javascript
    function _calculateRewards(
        uint256 periodId
    ) internal view returns (uint256) {
        (uint256 startTime, uint256 endTime) = IVoter(_caller)
            .getPeriodStartEndtime(periodId);

        if (endTime == 0 || startTime > block.timestamp) {
            return 0;
        }

        uint256 duration = endTime - startTime;
@>      uint256 emissionsPerSecond = _amountPerPeriod / duration; 
        //eg 1150e6 usdc / 1209600 sec = 950.73
        // 950.73 * 50000(sec) = 47,536,375.66137566 ~ 47,536,376
        // if calculated using this function we will have: 47,500,000
        uint256 lastUpdateTimestamp = _lastUpdateTimestamp;
        uint256 timestamp = block.timestamp > endTime
            ? endTime
            : block.timestamp;

        return
            timestamp > lastUpdateTimestamp
@>              ? (timestamp - lastUpdateTimestamp) * emissionsPerSecond //e instead use *_amountPerPeriod/duration
                : 0; 
    }
```
## Impact
Users will get less rewards than intended due to the precision loss caused by the division operation preceding multiplication. This subtle bug can significantly affect the overall rewards distributed, eroding user trust and potentially leading to legal disputes.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate the precision loss, consider adjusting the order of operations to perform multiplication before division. This approach leverages the fact that multiplication does not suffer from the same precision loss issues in Solidity. Additionally, using libraries specifically designed for fixed-point arithmetic, such as OpenZeppelin's SafeMath library, can help manage these precision issues more gracefully.

```diff
function _calculateRewards(uint256 periodId) internal view returns (uint256) {
        (uint256 startTime, uint256 endTime) = IVoter(_caller).getPeriodStartEndtime(periodId);

        if (endTime == 0 || startTime > block.timestamp) {
            return 0;
        }

        uint256 duration = endTime - startTime;
-       uint256 emissionsPerSecond = _amountPerPeriod / duration;

        uint256 lastUpdateTimestamp = _lastUpdateTimestamp;
        uint256 timestamp = block.timestamp > endTime ? endTime : block.timestamp;
-       return timestamp > lastUpdateTimestamp ? (timestamp - lastUpdateTimestamp) * emissionsPerSecond : 0;
+       return timestamp > lastUpdateTimestamp ? (timestamp - lastUpdateTimestamp) * _amountPerPeriod / duration : 0;

    }
```
