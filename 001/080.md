# bribe rewarder cannot work well with rebase reward tokens

## Summary
bribe rewarder cannot work well with rebase reward tokens

## Vulnerability Detail
In BribeRewarder, the owner can start to bribe via `fundAndBribe`. The contract will make sure that the owner has already provided expected token amount, which will be distributed to the voters.
```c
    function fundAndBribe(uint256 startId, uint256 lastId, uint256 amountPerPeriod) external payable onlyOwner {
        IERC20 token = _token();
        uint256 totalAmount = _calcTotalAmount(startId, lastId, amountPerPeriod);

        if (address(token) == address(0)) {
            if (msg.value < totalAmount) {
                revert BribeRewarder__InsufficientFunds();
            }
        } else {
            token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), totalAmount);
        }

        _bribe(startId, lastId, amountPerPeriod);
    }
```
The vulnerability is that actual reward tokens' amount may be decrease if the reward token is one rebase token. Even if the owner transfers enough token amount to the contract, voters may not claim their rewards.

## Impact
Users may lose their rewards.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Rebase token is not one kind of proper token for this scenario. Suggest to add one whitelist or blacklist to block rebase tokens.
