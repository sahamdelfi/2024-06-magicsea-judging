# User is forced to extend with at least position.initialLockDuration

## Summary

Due to wrong validation in `MlumStaking::_lockPosition`, when the user wants to extend his lock period, he is forced to extend it by at least `position.initialLockDuration`.

## Vulnerability Detail

Each NFT position in MlumStaking.sol has a lockDuration by which the users' voting power (multiplier) is calculated. This lock duration can be renewed and extended by the owner of the NFT. Unlike renew, where the lockDuration is set back to the original one from the time the function is called, `extend()` does not work in favor of the user.

Consider this example:

User has a position with 100 days lockDuration. On day 80, he wants to extend by 50 days to make the lockDuration 130 days from the time of the call. But due to wrong if check and wrong implementation this cannot happen.

As you can see, this case will pass line **699-701**, but will not pass line **706** because it forces `extendPeriod` to be at least `position.initialLockDuration`. The only way to get this to pass is to give `lockDuration` over `position.initialLockDuration`(100 days), which will make the user's `lockDuration` **over 200 days at all**.

```solidity
691	function _lockPosition(uint256 tokenId, uint256 lockDuration, bool resetInitial) internal {
692	    require(!isUnlocked(), "locks disabled");
693	
694	    StakingPosition storage position = _stakingPositions[tokenId];
695	
696	    // for renew only, check if new lockDuration is at least = to the remaining active duration
697	    uint256 endTime = position.startLockTime + position.lockDuration;
698	    uint256 currentBlockTimestamp = _currentBlockTimestamp();
699	    if (endTime > currentBlockTimestamp) {
700	        require(lockDuration >= (endTime - currentBlockTimestamp) && lockDuration > 0, "invalid");
701	    }
702	
703	    // for extend lock postion we reset the initial lock duration
704	    // we have to check that the lock duration is greater then the current
705	    if (resetInitial) {
706	        require(lockDuration > position.initialLockDuration, "invalid");
707	        position.initialLockDuration = lockDuration;
708	    }
709	
710	    _harvestPosition(tokenId, msg.sender);
711	
712	    // update position and total lp supply
713	    position.lockDuration = lockDuration;
714	    position.lockMultiplier = getMultiplierByLockDuration(lockDuration);
715	    position.startLockTime = currentBlockTimestamp;
716	    _updateBoostMultiplierInfoAndRewardDebt(position);
717	
718	    emit LockPosition(tokenId, lockDuration);
719	}
```

## Impact

The user is forced to extend for at least `initialLockDuration`, which will double his `lockDuration` from the time it called the `extend` function.

## Recommendation

Change the `extend()` logic to sum up the elapsed `lockPeriod` and the new `lockDuration` and then check if their sum is above `position.initialLockDuration`, this way the user will be able to pass 50 days as an extended period and their position will become 130 days, setting initial period at 80 and lockDuration at 50 days.
