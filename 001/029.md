# Wrong input validation while checking for locked position in Voter.sol

## Summary
Wrong input validation while checking for locked position in Voter.sol

## Vulnerability Detail
For a user to vote using Voter::vote(),  _minimumLockTime should be greater than initialLockDuration and position should be locked.

While checking for locked position, it checks position.lockDuration and this can be issue because lockDuration can be greater than _periodDuration but position is not locked
```solidity
 @>  if (_mlumStaking.getStakingPosition(tokenId).lockDuration < _periodDuration) {
            revert IVoter__InsufficientLockTime();
        }
```

// How this works
1. User created a position in MlumStaking.sol with lockDuration = 3 Months, which sets initialLockDuration as well as lockDuration = 3 Months
 ```solidity
    // create position
        _stakingPositions[currentTokenId] = StakingPosition({
       @>     initialLockDuration: lockDuration,
            amount: amount,
            rewardDebt: amountWithMultiplier * (_accRewardsPerShare) / (PRECISION_FACTOR),
       @>     lockDuration: lockDuration,
            startLockTime: _currentBlockTimestamp(),
            lockMultiplier: lockMultiplier,
            amountWithMultiplier: amountWithMultiplier,
            totalMultiplier: lockMultiplier
        });
```
2. After 3 Months, user position will be unlocked, but user can still vote and bypass the above check because lockDuration is still 3 months, which is greater than _periodDuration ie 14 days

## Impact
Users with unlocked position can also vote

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Check the position's remaining locked time(MlumStaking::_remainingLockTime()) instead of lockDuration & compare it with _periodDuration
