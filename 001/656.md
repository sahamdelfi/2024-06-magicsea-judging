# Incorrect calculation order in the `MlumStaking.addToPosition()` function when using `fee-on-transfer` tokens

## Summary

In the `addToPosition()` function, the transfer of tokens occurs after the calculation of the `avgDuration`. When using `fee-on-transfer` tokens, the actual amount received is smaller than the amount sent. This leads to an incorrect calculation of the `avgDuration` value.

## Vulnerability Detail

When the `stakedToken` is a `fee-on-transfer` token, the actual received amount is smaller than the original `amountToAdd`. So, the calculation of `avgDuration` at `L410` is done incorrectly, as it uses the original `amountToAdd` before the transfer. As a result, the `lockDuration` and the voting power are also incorrectly updated.

```solidity
    function addToPosition(uint256 tokenId, uint256 amountToAdd) external override nonReentrant {
        ...

410     uint256 avgDuration = (remainingLockTime * position.amount + amountToAdd * position.initialLockDuration)
            / (position.amount + amountToAdd);

        ...

420     amountToAdd = _transferSupportingFeeOnTransfer(stakedToken, msg.sender, amountToAdd);

        ...
    }
```

## Impact

Voting power is incorrectly updated when adding to existing positions.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The token transfer should be completed before the calculation of `avgDuration` is performed.

```diff
    function addToPosition(uint256 tokenId, uint256 amountToAdd) external override nonReentrant {
        ...

+       amountToAdd = _transferSupportingFeeOnTransfer(stakedToken, msg.sender, amountToAdd);
410     uint256 avgDuration = (remainingLockTime * position.amount + amountToAdd * position.initialLockDuration)
            / (position.amount + amountToAdd);

        ...

-       amountToAdd = _transferSupportingFeeOnTransfer(stakedToken, msg.sender, amountToAdd);

        ...
    }
```
