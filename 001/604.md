# Hardcoded `MAX_LOCK_MULTIPLIER_LIMIT` is set to 15000, lower than the initialized value of 20000

## Summary

The admin function `setLockMultiplierSettings()` allows the admin to set the max lock multiplier and the max lock duration. The multiplier is validated against `MAX_LOCK_MULTIPLIER_LIMIT`.

However the hardcoded `MAX_LOCK_MULTIPLIER_LIMIT` is set to 15000, lower than the initialized value of 20000. 

## Vulnerability Detail

In `MlumStaking`, `_maxLockMultiplier` is initialized to 20000. The admin is able to set said value, alongside the max locking duration, using `setLockMultiplierSettings()`. The max multiplier, specifically, is validated against `MAX_LOCK_MULTIPLIER_LIMIT`

```solidity
function setLockMultiplierSettings(uint256 maxLockDuration, uint256 maxLockMultiplier) external {
    // ...
    require(maxLockMultiplier <= MAX_LOCK_MULTIPLIER_LIMIT, "too high"); // @audit validated here
    // ...
}
```

However the `MAX_LOCK_MULTIPLIER_LIMIT` is hardcoded to 15000, where as the lock multiplier is actually initialized at 200% (signaling a 300% lock amount with multiplier).

Thus the admin is not able to use `setLockMultiplierSettings` for the original intended value of 200% should they want to change the max lock duration.

## Impact

Admin is not able to use setLockMultiplierSettings for the original intended value of 200% should they want to change anything e.g. max lock duration.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

`MAX_LOCK_MULTIPLIER_LIMIT` should be modified to 20000 or any intended higher upper limit, or the initial value should be validated against the limit as well.
