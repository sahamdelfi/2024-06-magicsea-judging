# Voters can claim their rewards even after end of next epoch

## Summary
[Based on docs](https://docs.magicsea.finance/protocol/magic/magic-lum-voting)
> Bribes as an additional incentive to vote can be claimed 24-48 hours after an epoch has ended.<ins>Voters can claim the rewards until the next epoch is ended</ins>. Unclaimed rewards will be sent back to the briber

Let assume Alice votes for a specific pool in first epoch and in second epoch no one vote for that pool but in third epoch Alice can claim her reward but this is against protocol rules
## Vulnerability Detail
**Textual POC:**
`BribeRewarder::fundAndBribe`,`BribeRewarder::bribe`,`BribeRewarder::deposit`,`BribeRewarder::claim` change _lastUpdateTimestamp and when no one votes for a the pool its mean `BribeRewarder::deposit` will not be called and _lastUpdateTimestamp will not be updated and when Alice calls `BribeRewarder::claim` in third epoch because first epoch's endTime is greater than  _lastUpdateTimestamp hence Alice will get reward

**Coded POC:**
add this function to Voter.t.sol and before that u have to change setUp function
```diff
+ RewarderFactory _rewardFactory;
function setUp()public {
...
+ address factoryImpl = address(new RewarderFactory());

+        _rewardFactory = RewarderFactory(
+           address(
+                new TransparentUpgradeableProxy2Step(
+                    factoryImpl, ProxyAdmin2Step(address(1)), abi.encodeWithSelector(RewarderFactory.initialize.selector, DEV, 
+ _rewardType, _rewarder)
+                )
+           )
+        );
```
```solidity
    function testUserClaimTheirRewardEvenAfterEndOfNextEpoch() public {
        ERC20Mock pool = new ERC20Mock("lp","LP", 18);
        ERC20Mock usdt = new ERC20Mock("USDT","USDT", 6);
        usdt.mint(address(this), 300e6);

        IBribeRewarder _bribeRewarder1 = _rewardFactory.createBribeRewarder(usdt, address(pool));
    
        _createPosition(ALICE);
        _createPosition(BOB);


        
        usdt.approve(address(_bribeRewarder1), 300e6);
        _bribeRewarder1.fundAndBribe(1, 3, 100e6);
        //start first epoch
        vm.prank(DEV);
        _voter.startNewVotingPeriod();
        address[] memory pools = new address[](1);
        pools[0] = address(pool);

        
        vm.prank(ALICE);
        _voter.vote(1, pools, _getDeltaAmounts());

        skip(14 days);
        //end of first epoch
        //start second epoch
        vm.prank(DEV);
        _voter.startNewVotingPeriod();
        //end of second epoch
        skip(14 days);
        //start third epoch
        vm.prank(DEV);
        _voter.startNewVotingPeriod();
        vm.prank(ALICE);
        _bribeRewarder1.claim(1);
        assertGt(usdt.balanceOf(ALICE), 0);
    }
```
## Impact
voters causes broken  contract rules
