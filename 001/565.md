# User can vote even with remaining mlum staked time 0

## Summary
In the magic sea documentation it is specified that for a user to be eligible to vote, they must have remaining lock period longer than the epoch time (14 days)
`Only valid Magic LUM Staking Position are allowed to vote. The overall lock needs to be longer then 90 days and the remaining lock period needs to be longer then the epoch time. 1 Magic LUM = 1 Vote`
https://docs.magicsea.finance/protocol/magic/magic-lum-voting
This is not followed in the code, where the remaining time is not checked.
## Vulnerability Detail
Here the check is not done for the remaining time and instead for the lockDuration, thus a user whose remaining time is less than epoch time will also be allowed to vote as long as `lockDuration < 14 days`. 
```solidity
if (_mlumStaking.getStakingPosition(tokenId).lockDuration < _periodDuration) {
            revert IVoter__InsufficientLockTime();
        }
```
## Impact
This will cause users to take advantage of the check, and can vote disregarding their remaining lock time. This is not the intended behavior as mentioned in the docs.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use the _remainingLockTime() function present in mlumstaking.sol instead to do the check.
```solidity
if (_mlumStaking._remainingLockTime(getStakingPosition(tokenId))< _periodDuration) {
            revert IVoter__InsufficientLockTime();
        }
```
