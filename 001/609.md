# The only first staker will get rewards, but others can't get because of wrong reward distribution

## Summary
In MlumStaking.sol, Current reward distribution logic is not correct, so only first staker can get rewards, even all of rewards amount of contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
There is not correct method to distribute rewards into every staker.
For now, staker can harvest the following pending reward
`amountWithMultiplier * (_accRewardsPerShare) / (PRECISION_FACTOR) - position.rewardDebt`
here rewardDebt = 0 for first staker, 
and then `_accRewardsPerShare = rewardBalance *  (PRECISION_FACTOR) / _stakedSupplyWithMultiplier` (reward token balance in MlumStaking contract), which is explained like below.
```solidity
        uint256 accruedReward = rewardBalance - lastRewardBalance;
        _accRewardsPerShare =
            accRewardsPerShare + ((accruedReward * (PRECISION_FACTOR)) / (_stakedSupplyWithMultiplier));
```
we can check that `lastRewardBalance = 0, accRewardsperShare = 0` for first staker

As a result, `pendingRewards = amountWithMultiplier * (_accRewardsPerShare) / (PRECISION_FACTOR) = amountWithMultiplier * (rewardBalance *  (PRECISION_FACTOR) / _stakedSupplyWithMultiplier) / (PRECISION_FACTOR) = rewardBalance` (here `amountWithMultiplier = _stakedSupplyWithMultiplier` after first staking)

It says that first staker gets all rewards, it's not correct.

## Impact
First staker gets all rewards, following stakers can't get rewarded unless contract owner transfers more reward tokens.

## Recommendation
It needs to redesign the reward distribution logic
