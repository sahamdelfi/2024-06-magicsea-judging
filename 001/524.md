# User with unlock position will able to vote due to wrong check

## Summary
User with unlock position will able to vote due to wrong check

## Vulnerability Detail
When a user vote, it checks for users locked position using `lockDuration` & compare it with `_periodDuration` which is 14 days
```solidity
  function vote(uint256 tokenId, address[] calldata pools, uint256[] calldata deltaAmounts) external {
//Code....
        if (_mlumStaking.getStakingPosition(tokenId).lockDuration < _periodDuration) {
            revert IVoter__InsufficientLockTime();
        }
//Code...
    }
```
Using lockDuration for checking position is locked or not can create issue because it can happen lockDuration is > _periodDuration but position is unlocked & this happens because lockDuration doesn't reduce over time

## Impact
unlocked position user can also voted
