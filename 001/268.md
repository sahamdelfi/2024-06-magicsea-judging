# Incorrect Lock Multiplier Calculation in MlumStaking Contract Reduces User Voting Power

## Summary
A medium-severity vulnerability has been found in the `MlumStaking` contract within the `addToPosition` function. The issue involves incorrect calculation of the lock multiplier when updating a staking position, leading to a potential loss of voting power for users.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `addToPosition` function updates the lock duration of a staking position when new tokens are added. However, it fails to correctly update the lock multiplier based on the new lock duration. Instead, it retains the old lock multiplier, resulting in users losing potential voting power that should be higher due to the increased lock duration and the multiplier.

## Impact
Stakers are disadvantaged as they do not receive the correct multiplier for their staked tokens based on the updated lock duration. This leads to a reduction in their voting power, impacting their influence within the protocol.

```solidity
function addToPosition(uint256 tokenId, uint256 amountToAdd) external override nonReentrant {
    _requireOnlyOperatorOrOwnerOf(tokenId);
    require(amountToAdd > 0, "0 amount"); // addToPosition: amount cannot be null

    _updatePool();
    address nftOwner = ERC721Upgradeable.ownerOf(tokenId);
    _harvestPosition(tokenId, nftOwner); // removes rewards

    StakingPosition storage position = _stakingPositions[tokenId];

    // calculate the avg lock time:
    uint256 remainingLockTime = _remainingLockTime(position);
    uint256 avgDuration = (remainingLockTime * position.amount + amountToAdd * position.initialLockDuration)
        / (position.amount + amountToAdd);

    position.startLockTime = _currentBlockTimestamp();
    position.lockDuration = avgDuration;

    // lock multiplier stays the same
    position.lockMultiplier = getMultiplierByLockDuration(position.initialLockDuration); // needs to change in regard of the new duration, not the old one

    // handle tokens with transfer tax
    amountToAdd = _transferSupportingFeeOnTransfer(stakedToken, msg.sender, amountToAdd);

    // update position
    position.amount = position.amount + amountToAdd;
    _stakedSupply = _stakedSupply + amountToAdd;
    _updateBoostMultiplierInfoAndRewardDebt(position);

    emit AddToPosition(tokenId, msg.sender, amountToAdd);
}
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Update the `addToPosition` function to correctly recalculate the lock multiplier based on the new lock duration. This will ensure that users receive the correct voting power based on their updated lock duration.
```solidity
function addToPosition(uint256 tokenId, uint256 amountToAdd) external override nonReentrant {
    _requireOnlyOperatorOrOwnerOf(tokenId);
    require(amountToAdd > 0, "0 amount"); // addToPosition: amount cannot be null

    _updatePool();
    address nftOwner = ERC721Upgradeable.ownerOf(tokenId);
    _harvestPosition(tokenId, nftOwner); // removes rewards

    StakingPosition storage position = _stakingPositions[tokenId];

    // calculate the avg lock time:
    uint256 remainingLockTime = _remainingLockTime(position);
    uint256 avgDuration = (remainingLockTime * position.amount + amountToAdd * position.initialLockDuration)
        / (position.amount + amountToAdd);

    position.startLockTime = _currentBlockTimestamp();
    position.lockDuration = avgDuration;

    // update lock multiplier based on new avg duration
    position.lockMultiplier = getMultiplierByLockDuration(avgDuration); // updated to new duration

    // handle tokens with transfer tax
    amountToAdd = _transferSupportingFeeOnTransfer(stakedToken, msg.sender, amountToAdd);

    // update position
    position.amount = position.amount + amountToAdd;
    _stakedSupply = _stakedSupply + amountToAdd;
    _updateBoostMultiplierInfoAndRewardDebt(position);

    emit AddToPosition(tokenId, msg.sender, amountToAdd);
}
