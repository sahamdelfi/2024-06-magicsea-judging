# User won't get accurate rewards under certain circumstances

## Summary
User won't get full reward if they add to their position when pool is locked 

## Vulnerability Detail

The owner can lock the pool  by calling `setEmergencyUnlock()` halting any function that has to do with changing position lock duration or creating new ones entirely.
The issue is that `addToPosition()` does not have that check that `createPosition(), extendLockPosition() and renewLockPosition()` which prevents users from calling them when pool is locked so user can extend their postion duration by adding funds to the position. This itself is supposed to be a bug as it was not listed as a known issue but it has a greater impact because an ignorant honest user can come to add to his/her position without knowledge of the lockdown. 

Inside the function  `addToPosition()` , `getMultiplierByLockDuration()` , is called which sets `lockMultiplier` to 0 because pool is locked which is used to calculate  `position.amountWithMultiplier` and `position.rewrdDebt`  when `_updateBoostMultiplierInfoAndRewardDebt()` is called at the end of the function. So no matter how long the user staked before the current amountWithMultiplier will be amount multiplied with 1 instead of the right multiplier which will affect the reward. And according to the design users can claim rewards and withdraw funds even when pool is locked.
Take this example 
bob creates a position for 365 days with 1 ether which makes his amountWithMultiplier 3 ether
owner locks pool to prevent deposit 
bob comes and add to his position with extra 0.1 ether and it goes through but his amountWithMultiplier is currently 1.5 ether because lockMultipluer returned zero as pool is locked so when he comes to claim rewards it will multiply it by 1.5 instead of 3.5.


## Impact
Inaccurate rewards for users due to protocol design

## Recommendation
Add a check to ensure users can't add to position when pool is locked as was done in other functions.
