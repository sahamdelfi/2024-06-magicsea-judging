# Bribe reward will be zero because of precision loss

## Summary
Let assume a user create a BribeRewarder with reward token GUSD and as we know GUSD's decimal is 2 and after that admin create a new epoch and Alice participates in that and in the end of epoch when Alice want to claim her reward she gets zero reward

## Vulnerability Detail
**Textual POC:**
As seen in `BribeRewarder::claim` function `BribeRewarder::_modify` is called which in turn call `BribeRewarder::_calculateRewards` and emissionsPerSecond computes based on amountPerPeriod divide into duration and because duration is 14 days[1209600] and its mean if amountPerPeriod be less than 1209600 emissionsPerSecond would be zero

**Coded POC:**
add this function to Voter.t.sol and before that u have to change setUp function
```diff
+ RewarderFactory _rewardFactory;
function setUp()public {
...
+ address factoryImpl = address(new RewarderFactory());

+        _rewardFactory = RewarderFactory(
+           address(
+                new TransparentUpgradeableProxy2Step(
+                    factoryImpl, ProxyAdmin2Step(address(1)), abi.encodeWithSelector(RewarderFactory.initialize.selector, DEV, 
+ _rewardType, _rewarder)
+                )
+           )
+        );
```
```solidity
    function testPercisionLossBribeRewarder() public {
        ERC20Mock pool = new ERC20Mock("lp","LP", 18);
        ERC20Mock gusd = new ERC20Mock("GUSD","GUSD", 2);
        gusd.mint(address(this), 300e2);

        IBribeRewarder _bribeRewarder1 = _rewardFactory.createBribeRewarder(gusd, address(pool));
    
        _createPosition(ALICE);

        
        gusd.approve(address(_bribeRewarder1), 300e2);
        _bribeRewarder1.fundAndBribe(1, 3, 100e2);
        //start first epoch
        vm.prank(DEV);
        _voter.startNewVotingPeriod();
        address[] memory pools = new address[](1);
        pools[0] = address(pool);

        
        vm.prank(ALICE);
        _voter.vote(1, pools, _getDeltaAmounts());

        skip(14 days);
        //end of first epoch
        //start second epoch
        vm.prank(DEV);
        _voter.startNewVotingPeriod();

        _bribeRewarder1.claim(1);
        assertEq(gusd.balanceOf(ALICE), 0);// BOB reward is zero
    }
```
## Impact
Bribe givers deposit assets into rewarder but eligible users cannot claim their rewards

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Its better multiple amountPerPeriod in a const value before divide it into duration
```diff
-uint256 emissionsPerSecond = _amountPerPeriod / duration;
+uint256 emissionsPerSecond = _amountPerPeriod * 10e18 / duration;
...
-return timestamp > lastUpdateTimestamp ? (timestamp - lastUpdateTimestamp) * emissionsPerSecond : 0;
+return timestamp > lastUpdateTimestamp ? ((timestamp - lastUpdateTimestamp) * emissionsPerSecond) * 10e18 : 0;
```
