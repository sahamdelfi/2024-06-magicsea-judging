# User can vote twice once the lock duration elapses

## Summary

The `Voter` contract allows users to vote for pools using their staked position's `tokenId` from the `MlumStaking` contract, ensuring the position meets minimum lock duration requirements. Once a vote is cast, the position is marked to prevent multiple votes in the same period. However, if the lock duration elapses, users can withdraw their funds, create a new position, and vote again, enabling an exploit where a user can vote twice.

## Vulnerability Detail

The vote functions of the `Voter` contract allow users to vote for specified pools using the `tokenId` of their staked position in the `MlumStaking` contract. The function checks if the [position's `initialLockDuration` meets the minimum requirements of `_minimumLockTime`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/Voter.sol#L172-L174) and ensures that [the position's `lockDuration` is at least equal to `_periodDuration`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/Voter.sol#L175-L177). Once a user votes, the [`_hasVotedInPeriod` mapping is updated](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/Voter.sol#L216) to mark that the position has voted in the current period, [preventing multiple votes with the same position](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/Voter.sol#L167-L169). The issue arises when the lock duration of the position elapses, allowing the user to withdraw all funds from the position. An attacker could exploit this by voting, withdrawing from the position, creating a new position, and voting again, thereby voting twice.

**Issue Scenario:**
1. User creates a position with a lock duration of 2 weeks, minting a position with id `10`.
2. Two weeks elapse.
3. User votes using `tokenId 10`, marking it as having already voted in `_hasVotedInPeriod`.
4. User withdraws from the position, destroying `tokenId 10`.
5. User creates a new position, minting a position with `tokenId 11`.
6. User votes again, this time using `tokenId 11`.
7. The user ends up voting twice using the same amount within the same period.

## Impact

A user can vote twice every `lockDuration` by voting, withdrawing from the position, creating a new position, and voting again.

## Recommendation

It is recommended to prevent users from voting twice by verifying the `startLockTime` of the position and ensuring it was not opened within the current period.
