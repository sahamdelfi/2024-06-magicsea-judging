# Voters will still be able to claim rewards after next period has ended

## Summary

The MagicSea protocol's documentation specifies that bribes can be claimed only until the next epoch ends. However, the current implementation allows users to claim rewards for all previous periods, even if the next epoch has already concluded. This behavior is not aligned with the documented claim period, leading to incorrect reward distribution.

## Vulnerability Detail

The documentation of MagicSea describes the behavior of a user claiming bribes as follows:

```txt
Bribes as an additional incentive to vote can be claimed 24-48 hours after an epoch has ended. Voters can claim the rewards until the next epoch is ended. Unclaimed rewards will be sent back to the briber.
```

In this issue, we will focus on the sentence, "Voters can claim the rewards until the next epoch is ended." This is not enforced in the code, as users are able to claim for all the previous periods of the rewarder, even if the next one has already been finalized.

```solidity
/**
 * Claim the reward for the given period and token id
 * @param tokenId token id of the owner
 */
function claim(uint256 tokenId) external override {
    uint256 endPeriod = IVoter(_caller).getLatestFinishedPeriod();

    uint256 totalAmount;

    // calc emission per period cause every period can every other durations
    for (uint256 i = _startVotingPeriod; i <= endPeriod; ++i) {
        totalAmount += _modify(i, tokenId, 0, true);
    }

    emit Claimed(tokenId, _pool(), totalAmount);
}
```

## Impact

The issue results in the briber assuming that unclaimed rewards from previous periods will not be distributed to the bribed user, but actually they will be distributed breaking the intended behavior.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend adapting the `claim()` function to allow only claims for the previous period and not all before. This can be implemented as follows:

```solidity
/**
 * Claim the reward for the given period and token id
 * @param tokenId token id of the owner
 */
function claim(uint256 tokenId) external override {
    uint256 endPeriod = IVoter(_caller).getLatestFinishedPeriod();

    uint256 totalAmount += _modify(endPeriod, tokenId, 0, true);

    emit Claimed(tokenId, _pool(), totalAmount);
}
```
