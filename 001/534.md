# Denial of Service (DoS) in Voting Mechanism for All Pools

## Summary

any user can incentivise voters to vote for a certain pool by registering a `BribeRewarder` for it, but due to a wrong check in `BribeRewarder` all votes to this pool will revert, leading to a DOS for all votes.

## Vulnereability Details

Voters can vote for a number of pools through the `vote` function in `Voter`. these voters will be getting the bribeRewards of any bribe rewarder registered for that pool and for that period:

- Voter
```solidity
function vote(uint256 tokenId, address[] calldata pools, uint256[] calldata deltaAmounts) external {
    ...
_notifyBribes(_currentVotingPeriodId, pool, tokenId, deltaAmount); // msg.sender, deltaAmount);
    ...
}
```

```solidity
function _notifyBribes(uint256 periodId, address pool, uint256 tokenId, uint256 deltaAmount) private {
        IBribeRewarder[] storage rewarders = _bribesPerPriod[periodId][pool];
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < rewarders.length; ++i) {
            if (address(rewarders[i]) != address(0)) {
                rewarders[i].deposit(periodId, tokenId, deltaAmount);
                _userBribesPerPeriod[periodId][tokenId].push(rewarders[i]);
            }
        }
    }
```

`_notifybribes` is looping over all bribes registered for this rewarder and calls `deposit` on each of them.

- BribeRewarder
```solidity
function deposit(uint256 periodId, uint256 tokenId, uint256 deltaAmount) public onlyVoter {
        _modify(periodId, tokenId, deltaAmount.toInt256(), false);

        emit Deposited(periodId, tokenId, _pool(), deltaAmount);
    }
```

- calling _modify
```solidity
function _modify(uint256 periodId, uint256 tokenId, int256 deltaAmount, bool isPayOutReward)
        private
        returns (uint256 rewardAmount)
    {
=>      if (!IVoter(_caller).ownerOf(tokenId, msg.sender)) {
            revert BribeRewarder__NotOwner();
        }
        ...
```

in line 264 the function is trying to check that the owner of the token is the `msg.sender`, but the problem is the msg.sender here is the voter contract as it is the one calling this function.

this will lead to all calls to vote for any pool which has any bribeRewarder registered for it to revert for all periods of the registry.

this can be exploited by an attacker to block all voting alltogether to any pool at any period, because any user can register a bribeRewarder through `RewardFactory`:

- RewardFactory
```solidity
function createBribeRewarder(IERC20 token, address pool) external returns (IBribeRewarder rewarder) {
        rewarder = IBribeRewarder(_cloneBribe(RewarderType.BribeRewarder, token, pool));
```

this creates a bribe for any pool the user chooses, then he can register it for as many periods as he wants using `fundAndBribe`:

- BribeRewarder
```solidity
function fundAndBribe(uint256 startId, uint256 lastId, uint256 amountPerPeriod) external payable onlyOwner {
        ...
        _bribe(startId, lastId, amountPerPeriod);
    }
```

basically allowing him to block all voting.

## Impact

This vulnerability results in a denial of service (DoS) for the voting process across any pool for any period. An attacker can exploit this flaw by simply registering `BribeRewarders` for the pool, thereby blocking all voting activities and disrupting the overall voting mechanism.

## Recommendation

Adjust the check in `_modify`. Since the `deposit `call by the `Voter `contract already verifies the `msg.sender`, this check is not needed and it's the one creating problems. However, the check remains necessary for the claim function. Therefore, instead of verifying ownership within each `_modify ` call, move this verification to the claim function:

```solidity
function claim(uint256 tokenId) external override {
    
    if (!IVoter(_caller).ownerOf(tokenId, msg.sender)) {
            revert BribeRewarder__NotOwner();
        }
    
    uint256 endPeriod = IVoter(_caller).getLatestFinishedPeriod();

```
