# Unclaimed rewards from the `emergencyWithdraw()` function remain permanently locked in the `MlumStaking` contract

## Summary

When using the `emergencyWithdraw()` function, rewards are not sent to the user, and the unclaimed rewards become permanently locked in the `MlumStaking` contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

When the `emergencyWithdraw()` function is called, the harvest process is skipped, so any accumulated rewards are not sent to the user. Additionally, there is no mechanism to release the user's unclaimed rewards. As a result, those rewards become permanently locked in the `MlumStaking` contract, as there is no sweep function to retrieve them.

```solidity
    function emergencyWithdraw(uint256 tokenId) external override nonReentrant {
        _requireOnlyOwnerOf(tokenId);

        StakingPosition storage position = _stakingPositions[tokenId];

        // position should be unlocked
        require(
            _unlockOperators.contains(msg.sender)
                || (position.startLockTime + position.lockDuration) <= _currentBlockTimestamp() || isUnlocked(),
            "locked"
        );
        // emergencyWithdraw: locked

        uint256 amount = position.amount;

        // update total lp supply
        _stakedSupply = _stakedSupply - amount;
        _stakedSupplyWithMultiplier = _stakedSupplyWithMultiplier - position.amountWithMultiplier;

        // destroy position (ignore boost points)
        _destroyPosition(tokenId);

        emit EmergencyWithdraw(tokenId, amount);
        stakedToken.safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);
    }
```

## Impact

Rewards not claimed during the `emergencyWithdraw()` function become permanently locked in the `MlumStaking` contract.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to either:

1. Release the unclaimed rewards in the `emergencyWithdraw()` function by subtracting the unclaimed amount from `_lastRewardBalance`.

```diff
+       _lastRewardBalance -= unclaimedRewards; // unclaimedRewards should be calculated
```

2. Implement a separate sweep function to retrieve the unclaimed rewards.
