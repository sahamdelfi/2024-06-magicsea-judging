# `BribeRewarder` will not handle fee-on-transfer tokens

## Summary
`BribeRewarder` is meant to handle all the ERC20 tokens but the fee on transfer tokens are not handled properly.
## Vulnerability Detail
When `fundAndBribe` function is called in the Rewarder contract by the rewarder contract owner, totalAmount is calculated according to the assigned `amountPerPeriod`, The contract transfers this calculated totalAmount from the owner but it doesn't take into the account the transfer tax charged in the transfer function. Because of this fee/tax the contract will receive less than totalAmount and the accounting will break. 

```solidity
 function fundAndBribe(uint256 startId, uint256 lastId, uint256 amountPerPeriod) external payable onlyOwner {
        IERC20 token = _token();
        uint256 totalAmount = _calcTotalAmount(startId, lastId, amountPerPeriod);

        if (address(token) == address(0)) {
            if (msg.value < totalAmount) {
                revert BribeRewarder__InsufficientFunds();
            }
        } else {
            token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), totalAmount);
        }

        _bribe(startId, lastId, amountPerPeriod);
    }
```
## Impact
Protocol accounting will break and intended amount will not get distributed in each period.

## Recommendation
Handle the case for fee on transfer token with before and after balance calculation.
