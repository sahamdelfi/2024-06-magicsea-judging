# Incomplete Reward Distribution in MlumStaking Contract with Missing Balance Tracking

## Summary
A medium-severity vulnerability has been found in the `MlumStaking` contract, specifically within the `_safeRewardTransfer` function called by `_harvestPosition`. The issue arises when the contract does not have enough reward tokens to fully compensate users, leading to incomplete reward transfers without tracking the shortfall.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `_safeRewardTransfer` function transfers reward tokens to users. However, if the contract lacks sufficient reward tokens, users receive only part of their entitled rewards. The contract does not track the remaining owed rewards, resulting in a loss for users. This flaw is due to the absence of a mechanism to remember and fulfill the remaining rewards when more tokens become available.

## Impact
Users may receive less than their deserved rewards if the contract's reward token balance is insufficient at the time of distribution. This can result in moderate financial losses and decreased trust in the staking protocol.

```solidity
function _harvestPosition(uint256 tokenId, address to) internal {
    StakingPosition storage position = _stakingPositions[tokenId];

    // compute position's pending rewards
    uint256 pending = position.amountWithMultiplier * _accRewardsPerShare / PRECISION_FACTOR - position.rewardDebt;

    // transfer rewards
    if (pending > 0) {
        // send rewards
        _safeRewardTransfer(to, pending);
    }
    emit HarvestPosition(tokenId, to, pending);
}
```

```solidity
function _safeRewardTransfer(address _to, uint256 _amount) internal {
        uint256 rewardBalance = rewardToken.balanceOf(address(this));

        if (_amount > rewardBalance) {
            _lastRewardBalance = _lastRewardBalance - rewardBalance;
            // add change variable
            rewardToken.safeTransfer(_to, rewardBalance);
        } else {
            _lastRewardBalance = _lastRewardBalance - _amount;
            rewardToken.safeTransfer(_to, _amount);
        }
    }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a `change` variable within the `StakingPosition` struct to keep track of any outstanding rewards. If the contract lacks sufficient reward tokens, the `change` variable should store the remaining balance. When rewards are distributed, check and transfer any owed amount from `change`.
```solidity
struct StakingPosition {
    ...
    uint256 change; // Track owed rewards
}

function _harvestPosition(uint256 tokenId, address to) internal {
    StakingPosition storage position = _stakingPositions[tokenId];

    // compute position's pending rewards
    uint256 pending = position.amountWithMultiplier * _accRewardsPerShare / PRECISION_FACTOR - position.rewardDebt;

    // add any owed rewards from previous insufficient transfers
    pending += position.change;

    // transfer rewards
    if (pending > 0) {
        uint256 transferable = _safeRewardTransfer(to, pending);
        uint256 remaining = pending - transferable;
        position.change = remaining; // store remaining rewards
    }
    emit HarvestPosition(tokenId, to, pending);
}

function _safeRewardTransfer(address to, uint256 amount) internal returns (uint256) {
    uint256 rewardBalance = rewardToken.balanceOf(address(this));
    if (amount > rewardBalance) {
        rewardToken.transfer(to, rewardBalance);
        return rewardBalance;
    } else {
        rewardToken.transfer(to, amount);
        return amount;
    }
}
```
