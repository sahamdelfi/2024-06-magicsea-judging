# Permissionless `BribeRewarder` registration will cause the bribing mechanism unavailable as an attacker will register `BribeRewarder`s with `_amountPerPeriod = 1 wei`

## Summary
Permissionless `BribeRewarder` registration will cause the bribing mechanism unavailable as an attacker will register `BribeRewarder`s with `_amountPerPeriod = 1 wei`.

## Vulnerability Detail

The creation of `BribeRewarder` is permissionless

and the registration of `BribeRewarder` into `Voter` is also permissionless

and there is a maximum number of `BribeRewarder` can be registered for a voting period

An attacker can exploit this to register a maximum number of `BribeRewarder` for many periods with each `BribeRewarder` has only `_amountPerPeriod = 1 wei`. This will prevent other `BribeRewarder`s from registering and the bribe reward for each voting period will always be zero.

## Impact

The bribing mechanism will be unavailable.

## Recommendation

Make the `BribeRewarder` registration permissioned.
