# `MlumStaking` rewards deposit can be front-run

## Summary

When rewards are deposited into the `MlumStaking` contract, they are distributed among the stakers, regardless of the stake period.

## Vulnerability Detail

The calculation of `_accRewardsPerShare` does not take into account the staking period.

```solidity
uint256 accruedReward = rewardBalance - lastRewardBalance;
_accRewardsPerShare =
    accRewardsPerShare + ((accruedReward * (PRECISION_FACTOR)) / (_stakedSupplyWithMultiplier));

```

## Impact

A malicious user can front-run deposit transactions and withdraw immediately afterward.
