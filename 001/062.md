# Subsequent user receives less reward while claiming in BribeRewarder::claim() due to wrong `_lastUpdateTimestamp`

## Summary
Subsequent user receives less reward while claiming in BribeRewarder::claim() due to wrong `_lastUpdateTimestamp`

## Vulnerability Detail
Let's go step by step to understand this issue(very simple example & times taken in hrs for easy calculations):
1. Suppose a bribeRewarder is created & bribed at 9AM to bribe 5th votingPeriod, which set the _lastUpdateTimestamp of bribeRewarder to block.timestamp ie = 9AM
 ```solidity
 function _bribe(uint256 startId, uint256 lastId, uint256 amountPerPeriod) internal {
....
        _lastUpdateTimestamp = block.timestamp;
....
    }
```
2. 5th votingPeriod started at 10AM for a duration of 2hr ie startTime = 10AM & endTime = 12PM
3. Two users(lets say userA & userB) voted for 5th votingPeriod at 10AM, which calls the bribeRewarder::_modify() that sets the _lastUpdateTimestamp to block.timestamp ie 10AM
```solidity
 function _modify(uint256 periodId, uint256 tokenId, int256 deltaAmount, bool isPayOutReward)
....
        if (block.timestamp > _lastUpdateTimestamp) {
            _lastUpdateTimestamp = block.timestamp;
        }
....
    }
```
4. After 3hrs ie at 1PM, userA claim his rewards, which calls _modify() -> _calculateRewards() that returns the rewardAmount to be 2hrs * emissionsPerSecond(based on `_lastUpdateTimestamp`) & again sets the _lastUpdateTimestamp to block.timestamp ie 1PM
```solidity
function _calculateRewards(uint256 periodId) internal view returns (uint256) {
        (uint256 startTime, uint256 endTime) = IVoter(_caller).getPeriodStartEndtime(periodId);

        if (endTime == 0 || startTime > block.timestamp) {
            return 0;
        }

        uint256 duration = endTime - startTime;
        uint256 emissionsPerSecond = _amountPerPeriod / duration;

    @>   uint256 lastUpdateTimestamp = _lastUpdateTimestamp;
    @>   uint256 timestamp = block.timestamp > endTime ? endTime : block.timestamp;
    @>   return timestamp > lastUpdateTimestamp ? (timestamp - lastUpdateTimestamp) * emissionsPerSecond : 0;
    }
```
5. When userB claims his rewards, _calculateRewards() will return `0` as _lastUpdateTimestamp(1PM) is greater than timestamp(12PM ie endTime). See above code

Note: This issue can appear in multiple form where users are loosing on rewards or leading to wrong calculations

## Impact
User will loose on rewards due to wrong _lastUpdateTimestamp
