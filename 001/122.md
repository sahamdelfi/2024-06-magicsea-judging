# Invalid authorized check for staking tokens

## Summary

The authorization check for operators or owners in the `MlumStaking::addToPosition()` function always returns true, allowing any user to access this function for any token ID.
## Vulnerability Detail

`The MlumStaking::addToPosition() `function is intended to be callable only by the owner or operators. It includes a check using `_requireOnlyOperatorOrOwnerOf()`, which uses` msg.sender` as both the owner and spender. This logic flaw results in the check always returning true, therefore allowing  any user to call `addToPosition()` for any token ID.

```solidity
    function _requireOnlyOperatorOrOwnerOf(uint256 tokenId) internal view {
        // isApprovedOrOwner: caller has no rights on token
        require(ERC721Upgradeable._isAuthorized(msg.sender, msg.sender, tokenId), "FORBIDDEN");
    }
```

## Impact

`MlumStaking::addToPosition()` can be called by any user to lock another users token further

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Modify the check to use the actual token owner instead of msg.sender:

```solidity
       require(ERC721Upgradeable._isAuthorized(owner, msg.sender, tokenId), "FORBIDDEN");
```
