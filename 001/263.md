# user may not vote at the begining of each voting period can lead to reward token stuck in the briberewarder contract

## Summary
The emission amount of reward tokens in the briberewarder contract is based on the duration of each period. However, the protocol begins release reward tokens only when the first user votes. If the first user does not vote at the beginning of each voting period, a portion of the reward tokens can become stuck in the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
the amount of reward token of each period is fixed after admin `fundAndBribe` [code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/rewarders/BribeRewarder.sol#L111-L124)

From the reward calculation method, we can see that the protocol begins to release reward tokens only when the first user deposits and updates.  [code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/libraries/Rewarder2.sol#L130-L143)
```solidity
    function update(
        Parameter storage rewarder,
        bytes32 id,
        uint256 oldBalance,
        uint256 newBalance,
        uint256 totalSupply,
        uint256 totalRewards
    ) internal returns (uint256 rewards) {
        uint256 accDebtPerShare = updateAccDebtPerShare(rewarder, totalSupply, totalRewards);

        rewards = oldBalance == 0 ? 0 : getDebt(accDebtPerShare, oldBalance) - rewarder.debt[id]; <@

        rewarder.debt[id] = getDebt(accDebtPerShare, newBalance);
    }
```

As a result, the reward tokens accumulated before the first user deposit become stuck in the contract. 

According to the briberewarder code, the briberewarder contract can contain multiple rounds, with the beginning of each voting period depending on when the admin invokes `startNewVotingPeriod`. Since the start of each voting period is not fixed, there is a high probability that users may not participate in voting at the beginning of the period. As a result, some reward tokens can become stuck in the contract during each period, leading to significant losses for the protocol.

test:
Assuming there is only 1 round of voting , the amount of total reward token is 10e18 . 
First user alice start to vote at the time of 50.

```solidity
    function testDepositMutipleNotStartFromBegining() public {
        ERC20Mock(address(rewardToken)).mint(address(this), 10e18);
        ERC20Mock(address(rewardToken)).approve(address(rewarder), 10e18);
        rewarder.fundAndBribe(1, 1, 10e18);

        _voterMock.setCurrentPeriod(1);
        _voterMock.setStartAndEndTime(0, 100);

        // time: 50
        vm.warp(50);
        vm.prank(address(_voterMock));
        rewarder.deposit(1, 1, 1e18);

        vm.prank(address(_voterMock));
        rewarder.deposit(1, 2, 1e18);

        //first period has ended.
        vm.warp(100);
        _voterMock.setLatestFinishedPeriod(1);

        vm.prank(alice);
        rewarder.claim(1);

        vm.prank(bob);
        rewarder.claim(2);

        console.log("alice:",rewardToken.balanceOf(alice));
        console.log("bob:",rewardToken.balanceOf(bob));
        console.log("total claim:",rewardToken.balanceOf(alice) + rewardToken.balanceOf(bob) + rewardToken.balanceOf(candy));
        console.log("remaining token:",rewardToken.balanceOf(address(rewarder)));
    }
```
out:

```shell
[PASS] testDepositMutipleNotStartFromBegining() (gas: 591445)
Logs:
  alice: 2500000000000000000
  bob: 2500000000000000000
  total claim: 5000000000000000000
  remaining token: 5000000000000000000
```
as a result , half of reward token become stuck in contract

## Recommendation
Allocate rewards to the first user who participates in voting, or add a withdraw function to extract unused reward tokens.
