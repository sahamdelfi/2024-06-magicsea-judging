# During emergency unlock, a user might transfer stakingToken from one position to another and thus cheat the voting system to vote more votes than his combined voting power.

## Summary
During emergency unlock, a user can withdraw from a position before the lock expires. As a result, the user can  transfer stakingToken from one position to another and thus cheat the voting system to vote more votes than his combined voting power. 

## Vulnerability Detail

In the following, we show a user can cast 2 ether votes even though his combined voting power is only 1076700000000000001:

1. Alice open the first position with 1 ether, creating a voting power of 1076700000000000000.
2. Alice open a second position with 1 wei, creating a voting power of 1. 
3. During emergency unlock, Alice cast a vote using the first position, used voting power of 1 ether;
4. During the emergency unlock, Alice withdraw 1 ether - 1 staking token from position 1 and then addToPosition to position 2, as a result, position 2 has the voting power of 1 ether. 
5. Alice votes using position 2, using the voting power of 1 ether. 
6. The final votes that Alice casted is 2 ether instead of 1.0767 ether. Alice voted nearly doubled of her voting power.

The POC is as follows (run ```forge test --match-test testStealVote -vv```):
