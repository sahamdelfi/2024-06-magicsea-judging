# Duplicate Registration Check Missing in Voting Contract

## Summary
The `Voting` contract lacks a crucial check to prevent duplicate registrations of bribe pools for the same period. This oversight can lead to unexpected behavior, such as double counting rewards, exceeding intended limits, and creating inconsistencies in the reward distribution logic.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `onRegister` function in the `Voting` contract does not check if a bribe pool has already been registered for a given period. This allows for multiple registrations of the same pool for the same period, which can cause issues such as redundant data entries, increased gas consumption, and potential exploitation by malicious actors.
## Impact
incorrect amount of reward distribution , more gas consumption

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a check within the `onRegister` function to ensure that the IBribeRewarder and pool combination has not been previously registered for the specified periods.
