# Wrong amount is used when calculation avgDuration in MlumStaking.sol

## Summary
In the MlumStaking the wrong amount is used when calculating the avgDuration for the lock in `addToPosition` function. The right amount would be the amountToAdd after the _transferSupportingFeeOnTransfer function is called.
## Vulnerability Detail
When a fee-on-transfer token is used there is a fee when the users send tokens to the contract. The actual amount that the user has sent is being calculated in _transferSupportingFeeOnTransfer. However when calculating the new lock duration the amount before the fees is taken which means that the duration will be longer than it should be.
## Impact
Everytime when a fee-on-transfer token is used, the duration calculated will be longer it should be. This leads to systematical error causing lock times to be longer than they should be.
