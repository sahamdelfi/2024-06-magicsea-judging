# Incorrect amountToAdd value in addToPosition() function

## Summary
If using Fee-on-transfer or deflationary tokens, an incorrect `amountToAdd` value could be used in the `addToPosition()` function.

## Vulnerability Detail
As stated in the scope, Fee-On-Transfer and deflationary tokens are supported. The `MlumStaking` contract implements the `_transferSupportingFeeOnTransfer()` function, which handles the transactions and retrieves the actual received amount. However, in the `addToPosition()` function, the `avgDuration` is calculated by using the `amountToAdd` value, which might be different to the actual received amount, instead of the output of `_transferSupportingFeeOnTransfer()`.


## Impact
The used `amountToAdd` value might be inaccurate and different to the actual received amount, resulting in an incorrect `avgDuration` calculation.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use the actual added amount as `amountToAdd` from the `_transferSupportingFeeOnTransfer()` function.
