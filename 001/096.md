# The `fundAndBribe` of `BribeRewarder` is not compatible with fee on transfer tokens

## Summary

The `fundAndBribe` function in the `BribeRewarder` contract is not compatible with fee-on-transfer tokens. It transfers `totalAmount` tokens to the contract using `safeTransferFrom` based on a calculation involving the number of periods and `amountPerPeriod`. The problem occurs in the [`_bribe`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/rewarders/BribeRewarder.sol#L226-L251) function, where a balance check fails for fee-on-transfer tokens because the actual balance can be less than expected due to transaction fees.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `fundAndBribe` function of the `BribeRewarder` contract is incompatible with fee-on-transfer tokens. Initially, it uses `safeTransferFrom` to transfer `totalAmount` tokens to the contract and then triggers logic in [`_bribe`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/rewarders/BribeRewarder.sol#L226-L251). `totalAmount` is calculated by multiplying the number of periods by `amountPerPeriod`. The issue arises in the `_bribe` function where the balance [check fails for fee-on-transfer](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/rewarders/BribeRewarder.sol#L237-L241) tokens because the actual balance is less than expected.

**Issue Scenario:**

1. User triggers `fundAndBribe` with 10 periods and `amountPerPeriod` set to 10.
2. `safeTransferFrom` is triggered to transfer `totalAmount`, calculated as 100 tokens, but due to a fee, only 99 tokens are sent.
3. The `_bribe` logic is executed.
4. The transaction reverts because the contract's balance is 99 tokens instead of the expected 100.

## Impact

The `fundAndBribe` function does not work for tokens with a fee on transfer, rendering the `BribeRewarder` contract partially inoperative.
