# `BribeRewarder` calculates rewards incorrectly after entering a new epoch

## Summary
## Vulnerability Detail
After entering a new voting epoch, `BribeRewarder::_modify` incorrectly calculates total rewards (`_calculateRewards`) from `_lastUpdateTimestamp` instead of epoch start time. 
as we can see in the code comments, a condition is set to prevent this from happening:
```solidity
        // extra check so we dont calc rewards before starttime
        (uint256 startTime,) = IVoter(_caller).getPeriodStartEndtime(periodId);
        if (block.timestamp <= startTime) {
            _lastUpdateTimestamp = startTime;
        }
```
_"extra check so we dont calc rewards before starttime"_, but the `if` statement is not implemented correctly, for example, if `_lastUpdateTimestamp` is 1 days ago, and `startTime` is 1 hours ago (i.e new epoch started 1 hours ago), since `block.timestamp` is more than `startTime`, this `if` statement will not be entered and rewards will be calculated from 1 days ago (`_lastUpdateTimestamp`) (i think developers meant to use `_lastUpdateTimestamp` in the if statement instead of `block.timestamp`?).
also in _calculateRewards, there are no checks to validate that `_lastUpdateTimestamp` is more than `startTime`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/rewarders/BribeRewarder.sol#L300-L313
```solidity
    function _calculateRewards(uint256 periodId) internal view returns (uint256) {
        (uint256 startTime, uint256 endTime) = IVoter(_caller).getPeriodStartEndtime(periodId);
        if (endTime == 0 || startTime > block.timestamp) {
            return 0;
        }
        uint256 duration = endTime - startTime;
        uint256 emissionsPerSecond = _amountPerPeriod / duration;
        uint256 lastUpdateTimestamp = _lastUpdateTimestamp;
        uint256 timestamp = block.timestamp > endTime ? endTime : block.timestamp;
        //@audit calculate rewards from 1 days ago
        return timestamp > lastUpdateTimestamp ? (timestamp - lastUpdateTimestamp) * emissionsPerSecond : 0;
    }
```

## Impact
shortage of reward tokens, since excessive rewards are calculated and accumulated, extra reward tokens must be provided so that all users will be able to claim their tokens.
this shortage of reward tokens is proportional to the gap between `_lastUpdateTimestamp` and `startTime`. for example, if `_lastUpdateTimestamp` is 7 days ago and a new epoch is started with a duration of 14 days, the collected rewards will be calculated from 7 days ago which means that half the reward tokens of this epoch (`_amountPerPeriod`) are calculated and distributed in the first deposit and later must be added into the BribeRewarder

## Recommendation
change this condition:
```solidity
        if (block.timestamp <= startTime) {
            _lastUpdateTimestamp = startTime;
        }
```
to this:
```solidity
        if (_lastUpdateTimestamp <= startTime) {
            _lastUpdateTimestamp = startTime;
        }
```
