# Not allowed staking position can vote for LUM emissions.

## Summary
The staking position whose remaining lock period is less than epoch time can vote for LUM emissions.

## Vulnerability Detail
The [MagicSea DOCS](https://docs.magicsea.finance/protocol/magic/magic-lum-voting) describes as follows.
```text
Only valid Magic LUM Staking Position are allowed to vote. The overall lock needs to be longer then 90 days and the remaining lock period needs to be longer than the epoch time. 1 Magic LUM = 1 Vote
```
However, the implementation of `Voter::vote` is the following.
```solidity
    function vote(uint256 tokenId, address[] calldata pools, uint256[] calldata deltaAmounts) external {
        ......

        // check if _minimumLockTime >= initialLockDuration and it is locked
        if (_mlumStaking.getStakingPosition(tokenId).initialLockDuration < _minimumLockTime) {
            revert IVoter__InsufficientLockTime();
        }
175:    if (_mlumStaking.getStakingPosition(tokenId).lockDuration < _periodDuration) {
            revert IVoter__InsufficientLockTime();
        }

        ......
    }
```
As shown above, `L175` doesn't ensure that the staking position is locked.

## Impact
The staking position whose remaining lock period is less than epoch time or even expired can vote for LUM emissions.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended that modify `Voter::vote` as the following.
```diff
    function vote(uint256 tokenId, address[] calldata pools, uint256[] calldata deltaAmounts) external {
        ......

        // check if _minimumLockTime >= initialLockDuration and it is locked
        if (_mlumStaking.getStakingPosition(tokenId).initialLockDuration < _minimumLockTime) {
            revert IVoter__InsufficientLockTime();
        }
-       if (_mlumStaking.getStakingPosition(tokenId).lockDuration < _periodDuration) {
+       if (_mlumStaking.getStakingPosition(tokenId).startLockTime + _mlumStaking.getStakingPosition(tokenId).lockDuration < block.timestamp + _periodDuration) {
            revert IVoter__InsufficientLockTime();
        }

        ......
    }
```
