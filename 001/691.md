# POSSIBLE UNDERFLOW IN  _safeRewardTransfer() function in the MlumStaking.sol contract

## Summary
In this `_safeRewardTransfer()` operation, the code first gets the current reward balance of the MlumStaking.sol contract using `rewardToken.balanceOf(address(this))` . It makes a subtraction operation which it wrongly assumes that the return value of **rewardToken.balanceOf(address(this))** is always less the **_lastRewardBalance**.
## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
1. `_safeRewardTransfer` internal function takes an address and amount as parameters. It first logs the total reward tokens in the MlumStaking.sol contract and assigns the value to reward Balance.

2. If the input amount parameter is greater than the current reward tokens in the contract, it makes a subtraction operation here, and updates the result to the **_lastRewardBalance** state variable.

3. However, this is likely to underflow if the current tokens in the contract is higher than the **_lastRewardBalance** value.  

4. The contract calculates or sets _lastRewardBalance to the number of reward tokens in the MlumStaking.sol contract during the call to `updatePool()`. See below :

5. Now, if between the time `_updatePool()` and `safeRewardTransfer()` is called, there has been an accumulation of reward tokens, the the current reward tokens balance will be higher than the previous one that is stored in **_lastRewardBalance.** And as such, the subtraction will underflow and revert.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Before making the subtraction, check that **_lastRewardBalance** is greater than or equal to the current tokens in the contract.. Or you can first call the `updatePool()` .
