# Voters in BribeReward receives reward for voting period they didn't voted for

## Summary
Voters in BribeReward receives reward for voting period they didn't voted for

## Vulnerability Detail
When a voter `claims` his rewards in BribeRewarder, it calculates the reward for `all` voting period starting from `startId` to `lastId`, regardless user voted for that period or not. This is an issue because everytime it calculates reward, it uses the `same amount` from `amounts.update()` for `all` voting period, but amount.update() stores the totalVote user voted not how many votes user voted in each voting period. As result voter receives reward for voting period he didn't voted for
```solidity
 function claim(uint256 tokenId) external override {
        uint256 endPeriod = IVoter(_caller).getLatestFinishedPeriod();

        uint256 totalAmount;

        // calc emission per period cause every period can every other durations
   @>     for (uint256 i = _startVotingPeriod; i <= endPeriod; ++i) {
            totalAmount += _modify(i, tokenId, 0, true);
        }

        emit Claimed(tokenId, _pool(), totalAmount);
    }
```
```solidity
  function _modify(uint256 periodId, uint256 tokenId, int256 deltaAmount, bool isPayOutReward)
        private
        returns (uint256 rewardAmount)
    {
        if (!IVoter(_caller).ownerOf(tokenId, msg.sender)) {
            revert BribeRewarder__NotOwner();
        }

        // extra check so we dont calc rewards before starttime
        (uint256 startTime,) = IVoter(_caller).getPeriodStartEndtime(periodId);
        if (block.timestamp <= startTime) {
            _lastUpdateTimestamp = startTime;
        }

        RewardPerPeriod storage reward = _rewards[_indexByPeriodId(periodId)];
        Amounts.Parameter storage amounts = reward.userVotes;
        Rewarder2.Parameter storage rewarder = reward.rewarder;

   @>     (uint256 oldBalance, uint256 newBalance, uint256 oldTotalSupply,) = amounts.update(tokenId, deltaAmount);

     @>   uint256 totalRewards = _calculateRewards(periodId);

  @>      rewardAmount = rewarder.update(bytes32(tokenId), oldBalance, newBalance, oldTotalSupply, totalRewards);

        if (block.timestamp > _lastUpdateTimestamp) {
            _lastUpdateTimestamp = block.timestamp;
        }

        if (isPayOutReward) {
            rewardAmount = rewardAmount + unclaimedRewards[periodId][tokenId];
            unclaimedRewards[periodId][tokenId] = 0;
            if (rewardAmount > 0) {
                IERC20 token = _token();
                _safeTransferTo(token, msg.sender, rewardAmount);
            }
        } else {
            unclaimedRewards[periodId][tokenId] += rewardAmount;
        }
    }
```
A user can vote for `only` one voting period between startId to lastId but will `receive` reward for all voting period because we are not calculating rewards based on how many votes user voted in each voting period but on totalVotes user voted, that results in reward for all voting period

## Impact
Wrong reward will be distributed among voters

## Tool used
VS code

## Recommendation
Store how many votes user voted in each votingPeriod and use it
