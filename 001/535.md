# In `Voter.sol` the `vote()` function is using wrong if statement when checking the `_periodDuration`

## Summary
`_periodDuration` should be checked if it is longer than the remaining lock duration of the position and if yes it should revert. The problem is that it is currently checked with the `lockDuration` which represents the duration that the user chose not his remaining one. This means that a user can create 1 position for 200 days for example and he will be able to vote in every epoch forever.

It is also said in the docs:
https://docs.magicsea.finance/protocol/magic/magic-lum-voting

`the remaining lock period needs to be longer then the epoch time.`

## Vulnerability Detail
When positions are expired they are not deleted, so this check can always be bypassed if you meet the requirement that your `lockDuration` is bigger than the `_periodDuration`

This is the check in the `Voter.sol` 

```solidity

 if (
      _mlumStaking.getStakingPosition(tokenId).lockDuration <
      _periodDuration
    ) 
    {
            revert IVoter__InsufficientLockTime();
    }
```
As we can see they use the `lockDuration` which makes the exploit of the voting possible. This is where the `lockDuration` is set when creating a new position in the `Mlumstaking.sol`

```solidity

  function createPosition(
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 lockDuration
    ) external override nonReentrant {
        
        ...

        // calculate bonuses
        uint256 lockMultiplier = getMultiplierByLockDuration(lockDuration);

        uint256 amountWithMultiplier = (amount * (lockMultiplier + 1e4)) / 1e4;

        // create position

        _stakingPositions[currentTokenId] = StakingPosition({
            initialLockDuration: lockDuration,
            amount: amount,
            rewardDebt: (amountWithMultiplier * (_accRewardsPerShare)) /
                (PRECISION_FACTOR),
>>          lockDuration: lockDuration,
            startLockTime: _currentBlockTimestamp(),
            lockMultiplier: lockMultiplier,
            amountWithMultiplier: amountWithMultiplier,
            totalMultiplier: lockMultiplier
        });
       ...
    }
```
This lockDuration variable represents the `lockDuration` that the user chose, it does not show how much of it is remaining


## Impact
High because a user can exploit the voting system and vote for every upcoming epoch with the same position even that it expired a long time ago.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
You already have `_remainingLockTime()` function in `MlumStaking.sol` that shows how much time it remains of the current position, just make the function external and use it in the if statement in `Voter.sol`
