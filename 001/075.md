# unchecked (finished `lockDuration` of `mlumStaking` positions) during `vote()` opening up the ability to double vote with same funds in the same period.

## Summary
unchecked (finished `lockDuration` of `mlumStaking` positions) during `vote()` in `voter`contract opening up the ability to double vote with same funds in the same period.
## Vulnerability Detail

in `vote()`
```solidity
File: Voter.sol
153:     function vote(uint256 tokenId, address[] calldata pools, uint256[] calldata deltaAmounts) external {
154:         if (pools.length != deltaAmounts.length) revert IVoter__InvalidLength();
155: 
///////////////...............skip
165:         uint256 currentPeriodId = _currentVotingPeriodId;
166:         // check if alreay voted
167:         if (_hasVotedInPeriod[currentPeriodId][tokenId]) {
168:             revert IVoter__AlreadyVoted();
169:         }
170: 
171:         // check if _minimumLockTime >= initialLockDuration and it is locked
172:         if (_mlumStaking.getStakingPosition(tokenId).initialLockDuration < _minimumLockTime) {
173:             revert IVoter__InsufficientLockTime();
174:         }
175:         if (_mlumStaking.getStakingPosition(tokenId).lockDuration < _periodDuration) {
176:             revert IVoter__InsufficientLockTime();
177:         }
///////////////...............skip
179:         uint256 votingPower = _mlumStaking.getStakingPosition(tokenId).amountWithMultiplier;
///////////////...............skip
216:         _hasVotedInPeriod[currentPeriodId][tokenId] = true;
217: 
218:         emit Voted(tokenId, currentPeriodId, pools, deltaAmounts);
219:     }
```
we see that in Line #167 we revert if the user has voted before in this Period

in Lines #172,#175 we check that `lockDuration` and `initialLockDuration` are larger than `_periodDuration`(14 days) and `_minimumLockTime` respectively

To give more context about `lockDuration` from `_mlumStaking`
- those are duration that the user chose to lock his `mlum` and is capped at 365 Days ( to prevent very high multipliers)
- those multipliers are used to get `amountWithMultiplier` that is used for rewards calculations - and voting power retreivals as seen in Line #179 

The problem here comes from the fact that there is no check for finished `lockDuration` of `mlumStaking` positions and i will describe with an example why 

- Alice stakes for 365 Days and gets max multiplier for his money
- Alice lock duration ends but he didn't withdraw his `mlumStaking` position nor renewed it
- Alice sees a Pool that needs votes and wants to vote for it (taking into considerations any intentions for doing so)
- Alice Votes for it
- Alice withdraws his position `fully` and destroy his position (burning the `tokenId` that he voted with before)
- In the same time Alice Deposit his full balance again and gets minted a new `tokenId` that is not registerd in `_hasVotedInPeriod` mapping
- Alice votes again for the same Pool


## Impact

now this has alot of impacts

- breaking invariant of being able to vote two times in the same period with the same funds
- stealing extra rewards from `BribeRewarder` contract connected to that Pool
- funds loss to other Pools in the voting period that should have had more weight than this Pool and would have gotten larger `mlum` emmissions
- voting manipulation and unfair results over all

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

check if `position.startLockTime + position.lockDuration) <= _currentBlockTimestamp()` revert the vote() with error `renew your lock` 

or you need to make sure that `position.startLockTime + position.lockDuration)` will be less than `_currentBlockTimestamp()` and will be less than the end time of voting period
