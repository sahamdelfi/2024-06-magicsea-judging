# Inconsistency Calculating MlumStaking, Position avgDuration

## Summary

The contract has functions designed to support tokens with fees on their transactions, but there are some inconsistencies when calculating `avgDuration` of a position.

## Vulnerability Detail

We have a function called `_transferSupportingFeeOnTransfer` that returns the number of tokens that arrived at the contract regardless of whether we are dealing with a token with a fee on transfer. This function is internal and is used in two different functions, `createPosition` and `addToPosition`. In `createPosition`, the fee is deducted at the **beginning**, and the reduced variable is used, whereas in `addToPosition`, the amount **before** deducting the fee is used. This inconsistency causes the calculation of `avgDuration` to use the amount before deducting the fee, **suggesting that we are depositing a slightly higher amount**, thereby manipulating the contract to shorten avgDuration in our favor.

## Impact

`avgDuration` is lower depending on the fee percentage of the token.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use `_transferSupportingFeeOnTransfer` immediately after `_updatePool`.
