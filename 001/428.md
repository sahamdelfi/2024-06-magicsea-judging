# Loss of reward if `emergencyWithdraw` is called

## Summary
If a staker calls the emergency withdrawal, they will lose their rewards, and the rewards will get stuck in the contract instead of being distributed to other stakers.

## Vulnerability Detail
When a staker calls `MlumStaking:emergencyWithdraw`, they will receive their staked amount without accrued rewards. These reward tokens should go to the other stakers. However, they will get stuck in the contract if another staker calls `harvestPosition` before an emergency withdrawal is called.

### POC

Here is how the flow works:

- DEV stakes 1 MLUM, and ALICE stakes 100 MLUM.
- 100 reward tokens are deposited.
- DEV calls `harvestPosition` to get their rewards.
- After some time, the owners enable `_emergencyUnlock` due to a short-term emergency.
- ALICE decides to withdraw her stake because of the emergency.
- `_emergencyUnlock` is then turned off again.
- At this moment, DEV is the only solo staker who has been staking from the beginning, and there are still some reward tokens in the contract. ALICEâ€™s unclaimed rewards should go to DEV, but this will not happen in this case.
- DEV could have received these rewards if he had not called `harvestPosition` before ALICE called `emergencyWithdraw`, creating a discrepancy in the reward calculations.

Here is a coded POC with the console to show how this plays out. 
Paste this is `MlumStaking.t.sol`

```solidity
 function testRewardLoss() public {
        _stakingToken.mint(ALICE, 100 ether);
        _stakingToken.mint(DEV, 1 ether);
        // DEV create a lock of 1 MLUM for 1 day
        vm.startPrank(DEV);
        _stakingToken.approve(address(_pool), 1 ether);
        _pool.createPosition(1 ether, 1 days);
        vm.stopPrank();
        // Alice also  creates a lock  of 100 MLUM for  1 second
        vm.startPrank(ALICE);
        _stakingToken.approve(address(_pool), 100 ether);
        _pool.createPosition(100 ether, 1);
        vm.stopPrank();

        _rewardToken.mint(address(_pool), 100_000_000); // 100 rewards sent to pool

        // DEV harvest his reward
        vm.startPrank(DEV);
        _pool.harvestPosition(1);
        vm.stopPrank();

        console2.log(
            "Rewards of DEV after initial harvest: ",
            _rewardToken.balanceOf(DEV)
        );
        skip(1);

        // Now the alice decided emergency withdraw because of emergency
        vm.startPrank(ALICE);
        console2.log("Alice pending Rewards: ", _pool.pendingRewards(2));
        _pool.emergencyWithdraw(2);
        vm.stopPrank();

        console2.log(
            "Rewards for ALICE After withdraw: ",
            _rewardToken.balanceOf(ALICE)
        );

        // At this point because ALICE didn't claim her rewards the alice rewards should now be free and DEV should be able to get that after the emergency is over after 1 week
        skip(1 weeks);
        vm.startPrank(DEV);
        _pool.harvestPosition(1);
        vm.stopPrank();
        console2.log(
            "Rewards of DEV after emergency is over: ",
            _rewardToken.balanceOf(DEV)
        );
    }
```

### Output 
```bash
Ran 1 test for test/MlumStaking.t.sol:MlumStakingTest
[PASS] testRewardLoss() (gas: 816233)
Logs:
  Rewards of DEV after initial harvest:  995392
  Alice pending Rewards:  99004607
  Rewards for ALICE After withdraw:  0
  Rewards of DEV after emergency is over:  995392 // This should be more
```
## Impact
Reward tokens are effectively lost when they could be used to incentivize stakers.

This should be viewed as a loss of funds, and a high severity rating is appropriate.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
There should be a mechanism to distribute remaining rewards to the stakers if extra funds are left due to `emergencyWithdraw`.
