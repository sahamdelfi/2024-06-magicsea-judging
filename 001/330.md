# `addToPosition()` might use incorrect `amountToAdd` value if amount received is different than input parameter

## Summary
The value of `amountToAdd` might change after calling `_transferSupportingFeeOnTransfer()` but it is used to calculate `avgDuration` before that.

## Vulnerability Detail
The MlumStaking does supposrt fee-on-transfer token by using the `_transferSupportingFeeOnTransfer()` whenever transferring staked token into the contract. As the result, the actual received amount might be different than the `amountToAdd` input parameter.

However, in the function `addToPosition()`, the `avgDuration` is calculated by using the input parameter `amountToAdd` even though it could be changed after calling `_transferSupportingFeeOnTransfer()`.
```solidity
function addToPosition(uint256 tokenId, uint256 amountToAdd) external override nonReentrant {
    ...
    // @audit amountToAdd might change after _transferSupportingFeeOnTransfer
    uint256 avgDuration = (remainingLockTime * position.amount + amountToAdd * position.initialLockDuration)
        / (position.amount + amountToAdd); 

    ...

    // handle tokens with transfer tax
    amountToAdd = _transferSupportingFeeOnTransfer(stakedToken, msg.sender, amountToAdd);
    ...
}
```

## Impact
`amountToAdd` might be inaccurate with the actual received amount, thus resulting in `avgDuration` calculation incorrect.

## Recommendation
Calculate `avgDuration` after getting `amountToAdd` from `_transferSupportingFeeOnTransfer()` function.
