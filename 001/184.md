# During emergency unlock period, users still can increase a position's `lockDuration` by calling `MlumStaking#addToPosition`, which makes the position eligible for voting in `Voter`

## Summary

During emergency unlock period, users still can increase a position's `lockDuration` by calling `MlumStaking#addToPosition`, which makes the position eligible for voting in `Voter`.

## Vulnerability Detail

The protocol can call `MlumStaking#setEmergencyUnlock` to start an emergency unlock period. During emergency unlock period, the expected behavior is users can not create a position with `lockDuration > 0`, nor renew the lock, nor extend the lock.

But users still can extend a position's `lockDuration` by calling `MlumStaking#addToPosition`

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/42e799446595c542eff9519353d3becc50cdba63/magicsea-staking/src/MlumStaking.sol#L410-L411

the calculation does not guarantee the new `lockDuration` will be less than the old one.

## Impact

Since voting in `Voter` will require position's `lockDuration` greater than or equal to  `_periodDuration`

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/42e799446595c542eff9519353d3becc50cdba63/magicsea-staking/src/Voter.sol#L175-L177

users can exploit this to make the position eligible for voting in `Voter`, during emergency unlock period.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add a check for `avgDuration` at `MlumStaking.sol:412`

```solidity
require(avgDuration <= position.lockDuration);
```
