# Transfer on fee token will cause loss to the protocol

## Summary

Users will receive more rewards than they should due to transfer on fee tax issues which is not accounted for in avgDuration

## Vulnerability Detail

I reported an [issue ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea-Smacaud/issues/2) earlier regarding how user can game the system with position.initialduration. 

However if the fix is to be used then the calculation of transfer on fee token for [amountToAdd](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/42e799446595c542eff9519353d3becc50cdba63/magicsea-staking/src/MlumStaking.sol#L420) needs to be moved before the [avgDuration](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/42e799446595c542eff9519353d3becc50cdba63/magicsea-staking/src/MlumStaking.sol#L410)

If this is not done, users will get more than they should thereby leading to loss to the protocol


## Impact

Users will receive more rewards than they should due to accounting issues with transfer tax

## Recommendation

Make sure the handling of transfer on fee token is done right before avgDuration
