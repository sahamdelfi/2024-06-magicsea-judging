# Funds Can Get Stucked on `BribeRewarder` contract

## Summary

The `BribeRewarder` does not offer a way to recover funds that can be stuck during normal protocol operations.

## Vulnerability Detail

There two main scenarios where funds can get locked inside `BribeRewarder` contract.
1. If the user registers the contract through the `bribe` function. In this case, the user needs to send the amount that is bigger or equal than the number of periods multiplied by the amount per period. However if the previous transfer amount is bigger the excessive tokens are stuck in the contract.
2. For the periods that no user votes or the voting power is less than the amount to distribute, the amounts per period are not distributed and stuck in the contract.

## Impact

Unnecessary lock of funds on the contracts.

      _bribe(startId, lastId, amountPerPeriod);
  }

## Recommendation

Allow to withdraw the excessive amount of tokens or native tokens to the owner in case no rewards require to be distributed or the transfer amount was over calculated.
