# `BribeRewarder` has no sweeping mechanism

## Summary

If nobody votes for a certain pool during an voting peoriod, some bribe reward will be left in the `BribeRewarder`. However, there is no 
sweeping mechanism in the `BribeRewarder`.

## Vulnerability Detail

If nobody votes for a certain pool during an voting peoriod, `totalDeposit` at [L37](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/libraries/Rewarder2.sol#L37-L39) is 0. So, bribe rewards for the epoch is not given to anybody.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/libraries/Rewarder2.sol#L37-L39
```solidity
37:     function getDebtPerShare(uint256 totalDeposit, uint256 totalRewards) internal pure returns (uint256) {
38:         return totalDeposit == 0 ? 0 : (totalRewards << Constants.ACC_PRECISION_BITS) / totalDeposit;
39:     }
```

So, the bribe rewards will be left in the `BribeRewarder`, and they will be frozen, because there is no sweeping mechanism in the `BribeRewarder`.

## Impact

Some Bribe rewards will be frozen in the `BribeRewarder`.
