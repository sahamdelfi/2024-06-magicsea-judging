# New ```LockingPosition``` can be created even if the pool has been unlocked in ```MlumStaking``` contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
[Comments](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/MlumStaking.sol#L355) in ```MlumStaking``` contract state that no new lock can be set if the pool has been unlocked. However, the contract does not enforce this rule and allows users to create new ```LockingPosition``` even if the pool has been unlocked checking only if the ```lockDuration``` is 0. If ```lockDuration``` is 0, the ```amount``` will just be equal to ```amountWithMultiplier```. We can see this here :
```solidity
    function createPosition(uint256 amount, uint256 lockDuration) external override nonReentrant {
        // no new lock can be set if the pool has been unlocked
        if (isUnlocked()) {
@>            require(lockDuration == 0, "locks disabled");
        }

        // ...
    }
```
This allows a user to create a ```LockingPosition``` even if the pool has been unlocked and actually increase the actual duration of the lock by just calling the ```addPosition``` later to the same position. We can see ```addPosition``` function here :
```solidity
    /**
     * @dev Add to an existing staking position
     *
     * Can only be called by lsNFT's owner or operators
     */
    function addToPosition(uint256 tokenId, uint256 amountToAdd) external override nonReentrant {
        _requireOnlyOperatorOrOwnerOf(tokenId);
        require(amountToAdd > 0, "0 amount"); // addToPosition: amount cannot be null

        _updatePool();
        address nftOwner = ERC721Upgradeable.ownerOf(tokenId);
        _harvestPosition(tokenId, nftOwner);

        StakingPosition storage position = _stakingPositions[tokenId];

        // we calculate the avg lock time:
        // lock_duration = (remainin_lock_time * staked_amount + amount_to_add * inital_lock_duration) / (staked_amount + amount_to_add)
        uint256 remainingLockTime = _remainingLockTime(position);
        uint256 avgDuration = (remainingLockTime * position.amount + amountToAdd * position.initialLockDuration)
            / (position.amount + amountToAdd);

        position.startLockTime = _currentBlockTimestamp();
        position.lockDuration = avgDuration;

        // lock multiplier stays the same
        position.lockMultiplier = getMultiplierByLockDuration(position.initialLockDuration);

        // handle tokens with transfer tax
        amountToAdd = _transferSupportingFeeOnTransfer(stakedToken, msg.sender, amountToAdd);

        // update position
        position.amount = position.amount + amountToAdd;
        _stakedSupply = _stakedSupply + amountToAdd;
        _updateBoostMultiplierInfoAndRewardDebt(position);

        emit AddToPosition(tokenId, msg.sender, amountToAdd);
    }
```
At the end, anyone can just create a new ```LockingPosition``` with a ```lockDuration``` non-zero even if the pool is unlocked.

## Impact
This vulnerability leads to the bypass of the intention and invariant of the team that new ```LockingPositions``` must not be created when the pool is unlocked. Also, this could lead to unexpected staking behavior, introducing unfair advantages to certain users over the users who had locked during the locked pool.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider disallowing the creation of new ```LockingPosition``` when the NFT is ```unlocked``` by making this change :
```diff
    function createPosition(uint256 amount, uint256 lockDuration) external override nonReentrant {
        // no new lock can be set if the pool has been unlocked
        if (isUnlocked()) {
-            require(lockDuration == 0, "locks disabled");
+            revert();
        }
        // ...
    }
```
