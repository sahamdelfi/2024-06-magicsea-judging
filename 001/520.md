# Malicious pool can be voted & passed while `emergencyWithdraw()` is enabled

## Summary
Malicious pool can be voted & passed while `emergencyWithdraw()` is enabled

## Vulnerability Detail
Attacker can take advantage of `emergencyWithdraw()` while voting to vote & pass a malicious pool.

1. Suppose emergencyWithdraw() is `enabled`, then attacker with `already` position which has > 3 months lock duration will `increase` his position using `addToPosition()` using flashloan
2. He will vote for that malicious pool and vote will not revert because lockDuration is > 3 months and initialLockDuration is also > 3 months
```solidity
 function vote(uint256 tokenId, address[] calldata pools, uint256[] calldata deltaAmounts) external {
//Code....
        // check if _minimumLockTime >= initialLockDuration and it is locked
        if (_mlumStaking.getStakingPosition(tokenId).initialLockDuration < _minimumLockTime) {
            revert IVoter__InsufficientLockTime();
        }
        if (_mlumStaking.getStakingPosition(tokenId).lockDuration < _periodDuration) {
            revert IVoter__InsufficientLockTime();
        }
//Code....
    }
```
3. Now, due to emergencyWithdraw(), attacker will be able to withdraw his staked tokens immediately, repaying his flashloan

## Impact
Attacker can vote for malicious pool and make it cross minVote required for pool creation
