# BribeRewarder.sol#claim - An attacker can drain the rewards via reentrancy

## Summary
An attacker can drain the rewards via reentrancy if the reward token is native. 
## Vulnerability Detail
If a user votes for a pool with bribe rewarder, when the period is over, he can claim the rewards for voting. Is the bribe rewarder is with a native reward token, a user can drain the rewards via reentrancy.

When the `claim` function is called, `_modify` is called inside it where the rewards are sent.
Let's focus on the following parts of the  `_modify`.

The problem is the user can continuously re-enter the `claim` function and he'll continue to get rewards because `rewardAmount` calculation will continue to return a number > 0 since there's nothing changed about it:
```solidity
      rewardAmount = rewarder.update(bytes32(tokenId), oldBalance, newBalance, oldTotalSupply, totalRewards);

      if (isPayOutReward) {
            rewardAmount = rewardAmount + unclaimedRewards[periodId][tokenId];
            unclaimedRewards[periodId][tokenId] = 0;
            if (rewardAmount > 0) {
                IERC20 token = _token();
                _safeTransferTo(token, msg.sender, rewardAmount); 
            }
```
Now let's also take a look at the `_safeTransferTo` function to actually see there's reentrancy possible. The function sends the native token to the account and if the account is a malicious he can re-enters the claim function when it receives native.
```solidity
    function _safeTransferTo(IERC20 token, address account, uint256 amount) internal virtual {
        if (amount == 0) return;

        if (address(token) == address(0)) {
            
            (bool s,) = account.call{value: amount}("");

            if (!s) revert BribeRewarder__NativeTransferFailed();
        } else {
            token.safeTransfer(account, amount);
        }
    }
```

## Impact
Attacker can drain all of the rewards.
