# Operators cannot add amount to a position

## Summary

Operators are not allowed to call the `addToPosition()` function as its comment states, leading to unimplemented functionality.

## Vulnerability Detail

The comments of `addToPosition()` states that this function ["Can only be called by lsNFT's owner or operators"](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/7fd1a65b76d50f1bf2555c699ef06cde2b646674/magicsea-staking/src/MlumStaking.sol#L395).

The  `addToPosition()` calls the internal function `_requireOnlyOperatorOrOwnerOf()` to perform above check. However, it restricts the caller must be the owner of provided position NFT.

As it is intended to allow operators to add amount to a position, the implemenation of `_requireOnlyOperatorOrOwnerOf()` is not consistent with the design.

## Impact

Operators cannot add amount to a position.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Update the function `_requireOnlyOperatorOrOwnerOf()` to grant permission to operators.
