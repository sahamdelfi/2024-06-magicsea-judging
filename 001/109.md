# Insufficient `addToPosition` access control allows anyone to call it

## Summary
Insufficient access control to the `addToPosition()` function makes it possible for *anyone* to call it for arbitrary `tokenId`, failing to provide protection for user's staking position.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `_requireOnlyOperatorOrOwnerOf(tokenId);` check used in `addToPosition()` consist s of a check:
```solidity
require(
            ERC721Upgradeable._isAuthorized(msg.sender, msg.sender, tokenId),
            "FORBIDDEN"
        );
```
Calling `_isAuthorized()` with both `spender` and `owner` set to `msg.sender` essentially makes it always return `true`. That's because of the assumption that the `msg.sender` is *always* the `owner` - which is not true. This means that there is **NO** access control for the `addToPosition()` function.


## Impact
According to the NatSpec the `addToPosition()` function:
*Can only be called by lsNFT's owner or operators*.

This assumption is broken, because anyone is allowed to call this function for any `tokenId`.

It also allows for modifying:
- stake amount: increasing the stake is generally positive for the staker, but it must be considered as an unexpected behavior
- `lockDuration`, depending on the `amountToAdd` parameter it is possible to significantly increase the remaining lock duration, especially if the position was relatively small. This might present many unexpected issues, for example if the user had a bot set up for withdrawing their stake at specific `block.timestamp`, or they needed their staked funds and where unable to withdraw it as expected after `initialLockDuration`.

Moreover, if any rewards are accrued, calling `addToPosition()` will internally call `_harvestPosition()`. This breaks another assumption, as all instances of calling `_harvestPosition()` are protected by `_requireOnlyApprovedOrOwnerOf()`, and harvesting should be available only to the owner and approved addresses for given `tokenId`.
## Proof of Code
A test file that is deploying locally all the required contracts from the codebase was created to provide proof of codes for MagicSea audit. In the ./magicsea-staking/test directory create a PoC.t.sol test file and paste into it the code from this [gist](https://gist.github.com/bbl4de/fbc6bba016f3bd876a12d0b06b7d78b8). For the code to compile the name of the ERC20Mock contract in ./src/mocks/ERC20Mock.sol needs to be changed to `ERC20MockWithRoles`.
Then, run:
```shell
forge test --mt test_anyone_can_call_addToPosition 
```
In this test `alice` creates a staking position, and then `bob` adds more stake to `alice`'s position with no permission, forcing her to claim rewards.

How the lock duration is increased depends on the amount of stake `bob` adds to `alice`'s position. If the `amountToAdd >> position.amount` the `avgDuration` (new `lockDuration`) approaches `initialLockDuration`. To quickly visualize the impact of `bob` being able to increase lock duration run:
```shell
forge test --mt test_addToPositionModifiesRemainingLockTime -vv
```
Manipulate the `amount` ( amount to add by bob ) in the test accordingly - position is created with `0.01e18` stake, so if the `amount` will be set to `0.1e18` the effect is already significant.

```solidity
 function addToPosition(uint256 tokenId, uint256 amountToAdd) external override nonReentrant {
        _requireOnlyOperatorOrOwnerOf(tokenId);
```

```solidity
 function _requireOnlyOperatorOrOwnerOf(uint256 tokenId) internal view {
        // isApprovedOrOwner: caller has no rights on token
        require(ERC721Upgradeable._isAuthorized(msg.sender, msg.sender, tokenId), "FORBIDDEN");
    }
```
Below, the `_isAuthorized()` function implementation, where we can see that if `spender != 0 && spender == owner` it always returns true:
```solidity
function _isAuthorized(address owner, address spender, uint256 tokenId) internal view virtual returns (bool) {
        return
            spender != address(0) &&
            (owner == spender || isApprovedForAll(owner, spender) || _getApproved(tokenId) == spender);
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To solve this issue modify the `_requireOnlyOperatorOrOwnerOf` function accordingly:
```diff
function _requireOnlyOperatorsOrOwnerOf(uint256 tokenId) internal view {
-       require(
-           ERC721Upgradeable._isAuthorized(msg.sender, msg.sender, tokenId),
-           "FORBIDDEN"
-       );
+       require(
+           _ownerOf(tokenId) != address(0),
+           "ERC721: operator query for nonexistent token"
+       );
+       require(
+            _isOwnerOf(msg.sender, tokenId) ||
+              _unlockOperators.contains(msg.sender),
+           "FORBIDDEN"
+        );
    }
```
