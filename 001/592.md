# The `BribeRewarder.fundAndBribe()` function will be reverted when using `fee-on-transfer` tokens

## Summary

When transferring `fee-on-transfer` tokens, the amount received is less than the amount sent. Therefore, when the `_bribe()` function is invoked within the `fundAndBribe()` function, it will revert due to a balance check.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `fundAndBribe()` function, tokens are transferred from the `msg.sender` to the contract and then the `_bribe()` function is invoked. Within the `_bribe()` function, a balance check is performed at `L241` to ensure that the contract holds enough tokens. However, in the case of a `fee-on-transfer` token, the actual received amount is less than the sent amount (`totalAmount`). Consequently, the check at `L241` will fail, resulting in the reversal of the entire transaction.

```solidity
    function fundAndBribe(uint256 startId, uint256 lastId, uint256 amountPerPeriod) external payable onlyOwner {
        ...
        
120         token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), totalAmount);
        ...

123     _bribe(startId, lastId, amountPerPeriod);
    }

-----------------------

    function _bribe(uint256 startId, uint256 lastId, uint256 amountPerPeriod) internal {
        ...

        uint256 balance = _balanceOfThis(_token());

241     if (balance < totalAmount) revert BribeRewarder__InsufficientFunds();

        ...
    }
```

## Impact

The owner cannot use the `fundAndBribe()` function to register their `BribeRewarder` contract with the `Voter` contract.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

In the `fundAndBribe()` function, when using `fee-on-transfer` tokens, it is recommended to send more tokens than required to pass the balance check.
