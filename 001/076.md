# The `vote()` function in the `Voter`doesn't `verify` the active status of `mlumStaking` positions, enabling users to cast double votes with same funds in a single voting period.

## Summary
The `vote()` function in the `Voter` contract fails to `verify` the active status of `mlumStaking` positions, potentially enabling users to cast double votes with identical funds within a single voting period.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `vote()` function lacks a crucial check on the expiration of `mlumStaking` positions. This oversight creates a loophole where users can manipulate the voting system. Here's a potential exploit scenario:

- Eve locks her tokens for the maximum duration (365 days), obtaining the highest multiplier.
- After her lock expires, Eve refrains from withdrawing or renewing her position.
- Eve casts a vote for her preferred pool.
- Eve then fully withdraws her position, destroying the associated tokenId.
- Immediately after, Eve re-deposits her entire balance, receiving a new tokenId.
- Using this new tokenId, which isn't recorded in the _hasVotedInPeriod mapping, Eve votes again.


This process circumvents the intended single-vote-per-period restriction.

## Impact
This vulnerability has several serious consequences:

1. It undermines the fundamental principle of one vote per stake per period.
2. It allows unfair accumulation of rewards from the BribeRewarder contract.
3. It distorts the distribution of mlum emissions among pools.
4. It compromises the integrity of the voting process, potentially leading to manipulated outcomes.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a check to ensure the lock duration hasn't expired

ensure that the lock expiration time extends beyond the current voting period's end time.
