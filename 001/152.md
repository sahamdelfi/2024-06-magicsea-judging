# Incorrect ownership check in `MlumStaking#addToPosition` will cause locking user's funds more than a week as an attacker will call `MlumStaking#addToPosition` to user's position at the end of locking period

## Summary
Incorrect ownership check in `MlumStaking#addToPosition` will cause locking user's funds more than a week as the attacker will call `MlumStaking#addToPosition` at the end of locking period.

## Vulnerability Detail

Since the check `_requireOnlyOperatorOrOwnerOf` always passes

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/42e799446595c542eff9519353d3becc50cdba63/magicsea-staking/src/MlumStaking.sol#L398

An attacker can call `MlumStaking#addToPosition` to a user's position to increase its locking duration. The new locking duration is `(remainingLockTime * position.amount + amountToAdd * position.initialLockDuration) / (position.amount + amountToAdd)`. At the end of a locking period `remainingLockTime` will tend to zero. To lock user's fund more than a week, the attacker will add to the position with `amountToAdd` such that

```bash
(amountToAdd * position.initialLockDuration) / (position.amount + amountToAdd) > 7 days
=> amountToAdd > (7 days * position.amount) / (position.initialLockDuration - 7 days) 
```

Required that `position.initialLockDuration > 7 days`. A position with large `position.initialLockDuration` will make it cheaper for the attacker to carry out this attack.

## Impact
Locking user's funds in `MlumStaking` position more than a week.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Fix the `MlumStaking#_requireOnlyOperatorOrOwnerOf` function

`src/MlumStaking.sol:140`

```diff
    function _requireOnlyOperatorOrOwnerOf(uint256 tokenId) internal view {
        // isApprovedOrOwner: caller has no rights on token
-       require(ERC721Upgradeable._isAuthorized(msg.sender, msg.sender, tokenId), "FORBIDDEN");
+       require(ERC721Upgradeable._isAuthorized(ERC721Upgradeable.ownerOf(tokenId), msg.sender, tokenId), "FORBIDDEN");
    }

```
