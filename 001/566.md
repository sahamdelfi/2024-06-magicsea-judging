# Reward balance of `MlumStaking.sol` is drained fully by the first user who call `MlumStaking::withdrawFromPosition`.

## Summary
When user calls `MlumStaking::withdrawFromPosition` it allows user to withdraw his position and take the accured reward which is generated by staking his MLUM tokens. So when the user withdraws because of some mathematical error the first one who withdraws from the `MlumStaking` get the whole `rewardToken` balance of the `MlumStaking` contract and this leads to draining of the `rewardToken` from the protocol contract account.

## Vulnerability Detail
Once the user staked his position and the lock duration gets completed he can withdraw his position by calling  `MlumStaking::withdrawFromPosition` which will withdraw him his staked tokens which is MLUM and also transfer the rewards he generated in the form of `rewardToken`. 

The problem here is because of some calculation error in the contract the first one to withdraw from the contract gets the whole contract balance of `rewardToken` in the form of rewards which leads to draining of all the `rewardToken` which is being there. So this can leads to issue because someone will just stake the MLUM token for the least amount of the time and can easily drain the whole balance in the form of rewards.

Let's understand this with example along with POC::
- Suppose there is a user who creates his position and stake 5 MLUM tokens for just 1 day.
- Let's assume the `MlumStaking` contract has the balance of `rewardToken` = 1 Million tokens. [1,000,000 * 10**6].
- Now after the locking period ends which is just a single day. The user will withdraw his stake fully or partially.
- It will reward him with the whole 1 Million token as the reward.

Here's the POC : Test it by running `forge test --mt testRewardWithMoreBalance -vvvvv` ::
```solidity
function testRewardWithMoreBalance() public {
        _rewardToken.mint(address(_pool), 1_000_000_000_000); // 1,000,000 *10^6 [1 Million reward token]
        _stakingToken.mint(ALICE, 10 ether);// 10 * 10^18 

        console.log("Contract initial Reward token balance:- " ,_rewardToken.balanceOf(address(_pool)));
        console.log("Alice initial Reward token balance :- ", _rewardToken.balanceOf(ALICE));
        console.log("------------------------------------------------------------------------------------");
        console.log("------------------------------------------------------------------------------------");

        // Creating Position
        vm.startPrank(ALICE);
        _stakingToken.approve(address(_pool), 5 ether);
        _pool.createPosition(5 ether, 1 days);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // Skipping the lock time to unlock it
        skip(1 days);

        // Alice withdrawing the position after successful lock completion
        vm.prank(ALICE);
        _pool.withdrawFromPosition(1, 5 ether);

        console.log("Contract Reward token balance after Withdrawal:- ", _rewardToken.balanceOf(address(_pool)));
        console.log("Alice Reward token balance after withdrawal:- ", _rewardToken.balanceOf(ALICE));
    }
```
**Here's the Output for the test :**

## Impact
Withdrawing of position from the first user who withdraws will leads to draining of whole contract rewardToken balance.

## Recommendation

Try adding checks so that user can only withdraw the amount which he generated as the rewards not more than that to prevent the whole balance to get drained in the form of rewards to the user.
