# In emergency situations, users can still claim their rewards or choose to retrieve some of the staking tokens before releasing the staking

## Summary
EmergencyWithdraw provides a method to ignore rewards and propose pledged tokens in emergency mode.
However, in emergency mode, it is very dangerous to call withdrawFromPosition to obtain rewards or choose to retrieve only a portion of the pledged rewards. This may pose potential risks.
## Vulnerability Detail
Once emergency mode is activated, emergencyWithdraw permissions will be open to everyone.
```solidity
    function emergencyWithdraw(uint256 tokenId) external override nonReentrant {
        ...

        // position should be unlocked
        require(
            _unlockOperators.contains(msg.sender) ||
                (position.startLockTime + position.lockDuration) <=
                _currentBlockTimestamp() ||
                isUnlocked(),
            "locked"
        );
        ...
```
However, please note that withdrawFromPosition will also be open to everyone, regardless of whether the lock time limit has been reached or not
```solidity
    function _withdrawFromPosition(
        address nftOwner,
        uint256 tokenId,
        uint256 amountToWithdraw
    ) internal {
        ...
        require(
            _unlockOperators.contains(nftOwner) ||
                (position.startLockTime + position.lockDuration) <=
                _currentBlockTimestamp() ||
                isUnlocked(),
            "locked"
        );
       ...
    }
```
This will allow all NFT holders to choose to partially retrieve the staking token and receive staking rewards
```solidity
    function _withdrawFromPosition(
        address nftOwner,
        uint256 tokenId,
        uint256 amountToWithdraw
    ) internal { 
        ...
        _harvestPosition(tokenId, nftOwner);

        // update position
        position.amount = position.amount - amountToWithdraw;

        // update total lp supply
        _stakedSupply = _stakedSupply - amountToWithdraw;

        if (position.amount == 0) {
            // destroy if now empty
            _stakedSupplyWithMultiplier =
                _stakedSupplyWithMultiplier -
                position.amountWithMultiplier;
            _destroyPosition(tokenId);
        } else {
            _updateBoostMultiplierInfoAndRewardDebt(position);
        }

        emit WithdrawFromPosition(tokenId, amountToWithdraw);
        stakedToken.safeTransfer(nftOwner, amountToWithdraw);
```
Due to the possibility that the reason for activating emergency mode is due to the calculation of pledge rewards, it is very dangerous to activate this part of the permission
In addition, users can also earn rewards by calling HarvestPosition before exiting
## Impact
In emergency mode, users may choose to claim incorrectly calculated reward tokens.And there is a significant potential risk involved

## Recommendation
```solidity
    function _withdrawFromPosition(
        address nftOwner,
        uint256 tokenId,
        uint256 amountToWithdraw
    ) internal {
        require(amountToWithdraw > 0, "null");
        // withdrawFromPosition: amount cannot be null

        StakingPosition storage position = _stakingPositions[tokenId];
        require(
            _unlockOperators.contains(nftOwner) ||
                (position.startLockTime + position.lockDuration) <=
-               _currentBlockTimestamp() ||
+             _currentBlockTimestamp()
-                isUnlocked(),
            "locked"
        );
        ...
    }
```
