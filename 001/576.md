# Non-Admins can able to Add/Modify an existing Staking Position without any owner or allowance rights.

## Summary

By using this vulnerability, non-admins can able to Add/Modify an existing Staking Position without any owner or allowance rights. 

## Vulnerability Detail

Once a user deposits their MLUM Tokens into the MlumStaking.sol contract, he'll be granted an NFT and will be recorded in form of a struct with respective parameters such as Amount, AmountMultiplier, lockperiod and so on. 

If user wants to add more funds into the position(Of course, in order to increase his rewards. Because more then deposits more the 
rewards), He can simply do it by interacting with the "addToPosition()" function with the given 'tokenId' and the 'amountToAdd'  values. 

> Where's the Issue is? 

As we can clearly see the dev comments on "addToPosition()", he clearly mentions that " Can only be called by lsNFT's owner or operators "

```solidity

    /**
     * @dev Add to an existing staking position
     *
     * Can only be called by lsNFT's owner or operators
     */
    function addToPosition(uint256 tokenId, uint256 amountToAdd) external override nonReentrant {
        _requireOnlyOperatorOrOwnerOf(tokenId);
        require(amountToAdd > 0, "0 amount"); // addToPosition: amount cannot be null
``` 

But upon verifying the "_requireOnlyOperatorOrOwnerOf()" function, we can see something is Fissy. 
```solidity
 /**
     * @dev Check if a userAddress has privileged rights on a spNFT
     */
    function _requireOnlyOperatorOrOwnerOf(uint256 tokenId) internal view {
        // isApprovedOrOwner: caller has no rights on token
        require(ERC721Upgradeable._isAuthorized(msg.sender, msg.sender, tokenId), "FORBIDDEN"); // @audit - seems like not a correct implementation
    }
```

```solidity
/**
     * @dev Returns whether `spender` is allowed to manage `owner`'s tokens, or `tokenId` in
     * particular (ignoring whether it is owned by `owner`).
     *
     * WARNING: This function assumes that `owner` is the actual owner of `tokenId` and does not verify this
     * assumption.
     */
    function _isAuthorized(address owner, address spender, uint256 tokenId) internal view virtual returns (bool) {
        return
            spender != address(0) &&
 >>          (owner == spender || isApprovedForAll(owner, spender) || _getApproved(tokenId) == spender);
    }
```

As you can see, the last line in the internal function 'isAuthorized()' returns true regardless of the caller as the function require statement satisfies 
-> spender(msg.sender) != address(0) : Indeed He isn't null address right?
-> owner(msg.sender) == spender(msg.sender) : Both address are same. 

Thus returning true and enabling us to continue the function "addToPosition" in MlumStaking.sol contract. 

## Impact

Couple of issues: 
*  Not following according to the documentation and also to the Dev comments. Clearly a violation. 
* Ability to addTokens to any user positions might result in loss of funds in most cases. What if user token Id is 4, but he mistakly deposited into TokenId 5. He clearly losses his funds. 
* Griefing: Not profitable for the owner, but an attacker can deposit large amount of sum into the Position in order to increase the avgDuration variable which will be later set as lockDuration. 

## Code Snippet

> Copy the given snippet into the MlumStaking.t.sol file and run the code:

```solidity
function testAddToModifiyAnyone()public {

        // Getting some Tokens
        _stakingToken.mint(ALICE, 2 ether);
        _stakingToken.mint(BOB, 1000 ether);

        // Locking the Tokens in StakingContract.
        vm.startPrank(ALICE);
        _stakingToken.approve(address(_pool), type(uint256).max);
        _pool.createPosition(0.5 ether, 90 days);
        console2.log("Before Adding to Position");
        _pool.getStakingPosition(1);
        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.startPrank(BOB);
        _stakingToken.approve(address(_pool), type(uint256).max);
        _pool.addToPosition(1, 100);
        vm.stopPrank();

        console2.log("After Adding to Position");
        _pool.getStakingPosition(1);

    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Simple recommendation would be correctly implementing the function to check whether the caller is the right owner or not.
