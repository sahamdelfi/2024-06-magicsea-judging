# BribeRewarder in case period duration is increased, emissionsPerPeriod can round to 0

## Summary

In case the voting duration is increased, certain `BribeRewarder` instances can issue 0 `emissionPerSecond` due to rounding issues.

## Vulnerability Detail

The current bribing mechanism works, by selecting the number of periods that you want to bribe and a single `amountPerPeriod`, indicating the total reward tokens issued for the period:

```solidity
function fundAndBribe(uint256 startId, uint256 lastId, uint256 amountPerPeriod) external payable onlyOwner {
      IERC20 token = _token();
      uint256 totalAmount = _calcTotalAmount(startId, lastId, amountPerPeriod);

      if (address(token) == address(0)) {
          if (msg.value < totalAmount) {
              revert BribeRewarder__InsufficientFunds();
          }
      } else {
          token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), totalAmount);
      }

      _bribe(startId, lastId, amountPerPeriod);
  }
```

**Then the owner do not have the ability to update the configuration.**

Rounding will happen in the following function ,which is used in all the functions in the Briber, including the reward token calculation, when the duration is period duration is being increased from the `Voter` contract, which is completely different than the `BribeRewarders` and there can be numerous instances of bribers, **so it is not expected to comply with all of them:**

```solidity
function _calculateRewards(uint256 periodId) internal view returns (uint256) {
      (uint256 startTime, uint256 endTime) = IVoter(_caller).getPeriodStartEndtime(periodId);

      if (endTime == 0 || startTime > block.timestamp) {
          return 0;
      }

      uint256 duration = endTime - startTime;
      uint256 emissionsPerSecond = _amountPerPeriod / duration;//@audit briber doesn't have control over the duration, it can be changed anytime

      uint256 lastUpdateTimestamp = _lastUpdateTimestamp;
      uint256 timestamp = block.timestamp > endTime ? endTime : block.timestamp;
      return timestamp > lastUpdateTimestamp ? (timestamp - lastUpdateTimestamp) * emissionsPerSecond : 0;
  }
```

Suppose the following Briber configuration:

- `rewardToken` - `wBTC` (6 decimals)
- current period duration is 604800 seconds (1 week)
- `_amountPerPeriod` is 1e6
- `emissionPerSecond` = 1e6 / 604800 = 1 wei

`Voter` owner updated the `_periodDuration` to 2 weeks and the change will be applied to the second period, Briber knows it will result in a complete loss for him but he can do nothing.

New period starts and the updated configuration looks like this:

- current period duration is 1209600 seconds (2 weeks)
- `_amountPerPeriod` is 1e6
- `emissionPerSecond` = 1e6 / 1209600 = 0.826, rounding to 0

Now all the voters will receive 0 tokens from the Briber since `BribeRewarder::_calculateRewards` will always return 0.

> Max impact will be all the Bribers that have registered for this period if we assume all of them will use similar configuration or at least token with smaller amount of decimals
> 

## Impact

Complete loss of funds for both Bribers and Voters if the period duration increases.
