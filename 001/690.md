# Fake Token Can Be Used To Block Real `BribeRewarders`

## Summary

The `Voter` function allows a maximum of 5 BribeRewarders. This should incentivise the community to vote for certain pools. However creating a BribeRewarder is permissionless. Users may create BribeRewarders with fake tokens to block the entrance of real incentivicers to the system and there is no way to prevent it.

## Vulnerability Detail

Anyone can create a `BribeRewarder` for a pool with a scam or fake token. This may achieve the exact opposite effect to the one desired.

## Impact

This can prevent the system for operating as expected.

## Code Snippet

[Voter.sol#L130-L144](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/Voter.sol#L130-L144)
```solidity
  function onRegister() external override {
      IBribeRewarder rewarder = IBribeRewarder(msg.sender);

      _checkRegisterCaller(rewarder);

      uint256 currentPeriodId = _currentVotingPeriodId;
      (address pool, uint256[] memory periods) = rewarder.getBribePeriods();
      for (uint256 i = 0; i < periods.length; ++i) {
          // TODO check if rewarder token + pool  is already registered

          require(periods[i] >= currentPeriodId, "wrong period");
          require(_bribesPerPriod[periods[i]][pool].length + 1 <= Constants.MAX_BRIBES_PER_POOL, "too much bribes");
          _bribesPerPriod[periods[i]][pool].push(rewarder);
      }
  }
```

## Recommendation

Allow the admin to erase fake `BribeRewarder` if detected.
