# Voter can still vote even if remaining lock period is less then epoch period.

## Summary
User(Voter) can still vote even if the remaining lock period of staking position is less then epoch period.

## Vulnerability Detail
In docs, it is stated that the voter needs to have overall lock period greater then 90 days and the remaining lock period is greater then epoch period(_period duration)see here:https://docs.magicsea.finance/protocol/magic/magic-lum-voting. 
In voter.sol , line https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/Voter.sol#L175 checks for remaining lock period less then the epoch period. But the _mlumStaking.getStakingPosition(tokenId).lockDuration will return lock duration rather the remaining period as it does not store the remaining lock duration.
See here:https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/MlumStaking.sol#L378
## Impact
As a result , user will bypass the check even if the remaining lock period is less then epoch period. Can break functions which assume vote position is locked until epoch period.
