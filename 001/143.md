# Attackers can get rewards immediately by fort-running the transfer rewardToken action.

## Summary

Attackers can get rewards immediately by fort-running the transfer rewardToken action.

## Vulnerability Detail

When the rewardBalance increases, the `_accRewardsPerShare` will be updated to distribute the rewards to each shares by calling the function updatePool. Therefore, when an attacker observes that rewardToken is transferred to the contract MlumStaking, he/she can fort-run it to create a position in advance, so as to get the reward immediately. After claiming the rewards, the attacker can withdraw the position. Eventually, the attacker can claim the reward at little to no cost.

## Impact

The attacker can claim the reward at little to no cost.

## Recommendation

When distributing rewards, the protocol should take into account how long the position has locked(or created).
