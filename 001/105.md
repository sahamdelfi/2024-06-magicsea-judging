# Voting is broken for bribed pools because of invalid owner check

## Summary

When users vote for a bribed pool using their MLumStaking tokens, they interact with the BribeRewards contract. However, the current implementation has an invalid owner check, causing the voting process to fail.

## Vulnerability Detail

Voter contract calls `BribedRewards::deposit()` here for a user with their tokenId.

```solidity
      rewarders[i].deposit(periodId, tokenId, deltaAmount);
```

In the BribeRewarder contract, the following check is performed to verify token ownership:

```solidity
      if (!IVoter(_caller).ownerOf(tokenId, msg.sender)) {
            revert BribeRewarder__NotOwner();
        }
```
Since the caller to BribeRewarder is the Voter contract, not the actual user, this check will always fail.

## Impact

The voting system for bribed pools is non-functional due to this invalid owner check

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Move the owner check to the Voter contract, as users interact with it directly. This way, the ownership verification can be correctly performed before the call to BribeRewarder.
