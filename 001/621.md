# Voting.sol :: User can vote even if the lockPeriod has ended for their staked Position.

## Summary

User can vote even if the lockPeriod has ended for their staked Position.

## Vulnerability Detail


In `vote()` we are checking whether the lockDuration of that spNFT < _periodDuration to find out whether the lock time has ended.

```solidity
function vote(uint256 tokenId, address[] calldata pools, uint256[] calldata deltaAmounts)) external {
    ....
if (_mlumStaking.getStakingPosition(tokenId).lockDuration < _periodDuration) {
            /*@audit user can vote even if lockDuration has ended since the current timestamp is not checked    , tokenId.startTS  +  lockDuration <  currentV0tingPeriod.startTime + _periodDuration*/
            revert IVoter__InsufficientLockTime();
}
...
}
```

But this comparison is simply comparing the  duration but not the actual timestamp.

So the user who has a postion whose `lockduration` > `2 weeks` (value of _periodDuration) , would be able to vote even though their `StakingPosition.startLockTime` + `lockduration` <<< `block.timestamp`.


## Impact
spNFT owner can vote even after the lockPeriod has ended.

## Recommendation
```solidity
if (_mlumStaking.getStakingPosition(tokenId).startLockTime + _mlumStaking.getStakingPosition(tokenId).lockDuration < currentVotingPeriod.startTime + _periodDuration) {
 
            revert IVoter__InsufficientLockTime();
}
```
