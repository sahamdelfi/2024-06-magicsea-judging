# Any unclaimed and undistributed bribe rewards are locked in the BribeRewarder contract

## Summary

The [`BribeRewarder`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/rewarders/BribeRewarder.sol#L31-L411) contract allows rewarding voters with bribes in the form of rewards for voting in a specified pool. Tokens funded via [`fundAndBribe`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/rewarders/BribeRewarder.sol#L111-L124) or transferred and used through [`bribe`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/rewarders/BribeRewarder.sol#L132-L134) are locked in the contract as rewards. If voters don't claim their rewards or if there are no voters, the owner cannot retrieve these tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail

The [`BribeRewarder`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/rewarders/BribeRewarder.sol#L31-L411) contract allows for providing bribes in the form of rewards to voters who vote for a specified pool. However, once the `BribeRewarder` is funded via the [`fundAndBribe`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/rewarders/BribeRewarder.sol#L111-L124) function or by transferring tokens and using the [`bribe`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/rewarders/BribeRewarder.sol#L132-L134) function, the tokens become locked in the contract as rewards. If there are no voters to reward, or if voters choose not to claim their rewards, the tokens cannot be retrieved by the owner. Essentially, the contract lacks a mechanism for retrieving tokens that were not used for rewarding or were not claimed.

This is also described in the documentation: https://docs.magicsea.finance/protocol/magic/magic-lum-voting

> Bribes as an additional incentive to vote can be claimed 24-48 hours after an epoch has ended. Voters can claim the rewards until the next epoch is ended. Unclaimed rewards will be sent back to the briber.

  
Additionally, since rewards are calculated when the deposit logic is triggered, all rewards accumulated up to the first deposit will be locked in the contract and cannot be retrieved.

## Impact

The tokens allocated for bribe rewards that were not distributed to users or were left unclaimed remain locked in the contract and cannot be retrieved.

## Recommendation

It is recommended to add functionality for the owner to retrieve undistributed and unclaimed rewards.
