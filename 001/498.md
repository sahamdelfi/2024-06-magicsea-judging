# Anyone can call addToPosition

## Summary

Anyone can call `addToPosition()` for any tokenId in `MlumStaking.sol`, even if it should only be called by the owner or operators of the NFT.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
function addToPosition(uint256 tokenId, uint256 amountToAdd) external override nonReentrant {
    _requireOnlyOperatorOrOwnerOf(tokenId); // AUDIT - can be called from anyone
    require(amountToAdd > 0, "0 amount"); // addToPosition: amount cannot be null

    _updatePool();
    address nftOwner = ERC721Upgradeable.ownerOf(tokenId);
    _harvestPosition(tokenId, nftOwner);

    StakingPosition storage position = _stakingPositions[tokenId];
    ...
    ...
}
```

`addToPosition()` uses `_requireOnlyOperatorOrOwnerOf()` which internally should check if the caller is the owner of the NFT or one of the contract operators, but in reality anyone will pass this check because it uses `ERC721Upgradeable._isAuthorized` and passes `msg.sender` for both `owner` and `spender` and this will always return true because `owner = spender`.

```solidity
function _requireOnlyOperatorOrOwnerOf(uint256 tokenId) internal view {
    // isApprovedOrOwner: caller has no rights on token
    require(ERC721Upgradeable._isAuthorized(msg.sender, msg.sender, tokenId), "FORBIDDEN");
}
```

```solidity
function _isAuthorized(address owner, address spender, uint256 tokenId) internal view virtual returns (bool) {
    return
        spender != address(0) &&
        (owner == spender || isApprovedForAll(owner, spender) || _getApproved(tokenId) == spender);
}
```

## Impact

Because of this, anyone can call `addToPosition` on any `tokenId` and grief when nftOwner wants to destroy his NFT (with full withdraw) by just frontrun him with `addToPosition()` for his NFT and deposit 1 wei.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Change `_requireOnlyOperatorOrOwnerOf` to pass real owner of `tokenId` to `_isAuthorized()` and include operator checks as there are none now.
