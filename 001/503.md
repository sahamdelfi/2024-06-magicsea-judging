# MlumStaking::addToPosition doesnâ€™t consider fee-on-transfer tokens, unfairly calculating the avgDuration

## Summary

Tokens with fee-on-transfer mechanisms will unfairly increase the lock duration of positions in `MlumStaking::addToPosition`

## Vulnerability Detail

The team mentioned that all weird ERC20 tokens are in scope, this is applicable also for `MlumStaking`, as we can see there is a helper function to handle fee-on-transfer tokens:

```solidity
function _transferSupportingFeeOnTransfer(IERC20 token, address user, uint256 amount)
      internal
      returns (uint256 receivedAmount)
  {
      uint256 previousBalance = token.balanceOf(address(this));
      token.safeTransferFrom(user, address(this), amount);
      return token.balanceOf(address(this)) - previousBalance;
  }
```

The problem is in the `addToPosition` function and the fact that it uses the raw `amountToAdd` to calculate the new average duration of the lock, instead of the actual tokens deposited as it is being done in `createPosition`. In case token with high fee is being used as a `stakedToken`, duration will unfairly increased vs. highly decreased actual rewards, after fee has been taken from the transferred amount.

```solidity
function addToPosition(uint256 tokenId, uint256 amountToAdd) external override nonReentrant {
      _requireOnlyOperatorOrOwnerOf(tokenId);
      require(amountToAdd > 0, "0 amount"); // addToPosition: amount cannot be null

      _updatePool();
      address nftOwner = ERC721Upgradeable.ownerOf(tokenId);
      _harvestPosition(tokenId, nftOwner);

      StakingPosition storage position = _stakingPositions[tokenId];

      // we calculate the avg lock time:
      // lock_duration = (remainin_lock_time * staked_amount + amount_to_add * inital_lock_duration) / (staked_amount + amount_to_add)
      uint256 remainingLockTime = _remainingLockTime(position);
      uint256 avgDuration = (remainingLockTime * position.amount + amountToAdd * position.initialLockDuration)
          / (position.amount + amountToAdd);

      position.startLockTime = _currentBlockTimestamp();
      position.lockDuration = avgDuration;

      // lock multiplier stays the same
      position.lockMultiplier = getMultiplierByLockDuration(position.initialLockDuration);

      // handle tokens with transfer tax
      amountToAdd = _transferSupportingFeeOnTransfer(stakedToken, msg.sender, amountToAdd);

      // update position
      position.amount = position.amount + amountToAdd;
      _stakedSupply = _stakedSupply + amountToAdd;
      _updateBoostMultiplierInfoAndRewardDebt(position);

      emit AddToPosition(tokenId, msg.sender, amountToAdd);
  }
```

## Impact

Average durations extend is calculated before tax is taken, extending it unfairly, while the rewards that will be received for this period are calculated after deducting the fee, leading to worse ratio of time locked/rewards.

## Recommendation

Move this line: `amountToAdd = _transferSupportingFeeOnTransfer(stakedToken, msg.sender, amountToAdd);` before new lock time is recalculated.
