# Duration per second could lead to zero if too small

## Summary

In the `BribeRewarder::_calculateRewards` function, there is a potential vulnerability due to the order of operations: division is performed before multiplication. This can result in an incorrect computation of rewards, particularly when the `_amountPerPeriod` is smaller than `duration`, leading to a division that returns zero.

## Vulnerability Detail

The function `BribeRewarder::_calculateRewards` computes `emissionsPerSecond` by dividing `_amountPerPeriod` by `duration`. If `_amountPerPeriod` is smaller than `duration`, the result of this division will be zero, causing the reward calculation to be incorrect. This issue arises because integer division in Solidity truncates the decimal part, potentially leading to a zero value when the divisor is larger than the dividend.

### Proof of Concept

Consider the following scenario:

- `_amountPerPeriod = 50`
- `duration = 100`

The calculation of `emissionsPerSecond` would be:

```solidity
uint256 emissionsPerSecond = 50 / 100;
```

Since Solidity performs integer division, `emissionsPerSecond` will be `0`. This results in the reward calculation always returning zero, regardless of the actual duration or timestamps, leading to users not being able to claim their rewards.

## Impact

The incorrect computation of rewards means users cannot claim their rightful rewards, leading to a loss of rewards and potentially causing tokens to be stuck in the contract. This impacts the contract's functionality and user trust.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function _calculateRewards(
    uint256 periodId
) internal view returns (uint256) {
    (uint256 startTime, uint256 endTime) = IVoter(_caller)
        .getPeriodStartEndtime(periodId);

    if (endTime == 0 || startTime > block.timestamp) {
        return 0;
    }

    uint256 duration = endTime - startTime;
    uint256 emissionsPerSecond = _amountPerPeriod / duration;

    uint256 lastUpdateTimestamp = _lastUpdateTimestamp;
    uint256 timestamp = block.timestamp > endTime
        ? endTime
        : block.timestamp;
    return
        timestamp > lastUpdateTimestamp
            ? (timestamp - lastUpdateTimestamp) * emissionsPerSecond
            : 0;
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To ensure correct reward computation, consider rearranging the operations to multiply first and then divide. This avoids the potential loss of precision due to integer division. The revised code snippet is shown below:

```solidity
function _calculateRewards(
    uint256 periodId
) internal view returns (uint256) {
    (uint256 startTime, uint256 endTime) = IVoter(_caller)
        .getPeriodStartEndtime(periodId);

    if (endTime == 0 || startTime > block.timestamp) {
        return 0;
    }

    uint256 duration = endTime - startTime;

    // Use SafeMath for multiplication and division
    uint256 lastUpdateTimestamp = _lastUpdateTimestamp;
    uint256 timestamp = block.timestamp > endTime
        ? endTime
        : block.timestamp;

    uint256 reward = (timestamp > lastUpdateTimestamp)
        ? (_amountPerPeriod * (timestamp - lastUpdateTimestamp)) / duration
        : 0;

    return reward;
}
```

By multiplying first and then dividing, this approach ensures that the precision is maintained and the correct rewards are computed. Additionally, using SafeMath (or the built-in Solidity 0.8+ overflow checks) can help prevent overflow and underflow errors.
