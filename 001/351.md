# A malicious user can push in a malicious rewarder contract into voter contract

## Summary
There is no permission check in [Voter.sol::onRegister](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/Voter.sol#L130-L144), although the TODO comment indicates that the developer plans to add a check to ensure the rewarder comes from an allowed `RewarderFactory` to prevent malicious rewarder contracts. However, [RewarderFactory::createBribeRewarder](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/rewarders/RewarderFactory.sol#L109-L113)  is also permissionless. A malicious user could specify a pool token and register it to the voter contract, reaching the `MAX_BRIBES_PER_POOL` limitation, thereby preventing any new rewarders from being added for that specific pool token.

## Vulnerability Detail
From [Voter.sol::onRegister](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/Voter.sol#L130-L144) we can see the developer plans to add a check to ensure the rewarder comes from an allowed `RewarderFactory`
```solidity
    /**
     * @dev bribe rewarder registers itself
     * TODO check if rewarder is from allowed rewarderFactory. <@
     */
    function onRegister() external override {
        IBribeRewarder rewarder = IBribeRewarder(msg.sender);

        _checkRegisterCaller(rewarder);

        uint256 currentPeriodId = _currentVotingPeriodId;
        (address pool, uint256[] memory periods) = rewarder.getBribePeriods();
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < periods.length; ++i) {
            // TODO check if rewarder token + pool  is already registered

            require(periods[i] >= currentPeriodId, "wrong period");
            require(_bribesPerPriod[periods[i]][pool].length + 1 <= Constants.MAX_BRIBES_PER_POOL, "too much bribes");   <@
            _bribesPerPriod[periods[i]][pool].push(rewarder);
        }
    }
```

on [RewarderFactory.sol::createBribeRewarder](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/rewarders/RewarderFactory.sol#L109-L113)  there is no permission check , anyone can invoke `createBribeRewarder` to create a `BribeRewarder` and then register it on `Voter.sol`
```solidity
  function createBribeRewarder(IERC20 token, address pool) external returns (IBribeRewarder rewarder) {
      rewarder = IBribeRewarder(_cloneBribe(RewarderType.BribeRewarder, token, pool));

      emit BribeRewarderCreated(RewarderType.BribeRewarder, token, pool, rewarder);
  }
```

and from above `onRegister` there is a `MAX_BRIBES_PER_POOL` check , a malicious user can register 5 rewarder contract to reach the check which can lead to no more BribeRewarders can be added to voter contract for a specific pool.


## Impact
malicious user  can prevent bribeRewarder to be added to voter contract
