# There is no check for minimum staking duration in `MlumStaking.sol`

## Summary

There is no minimum check for the staking duration in `MlumStaking.sol`, this means that a user can stake for only 1 second and he will still receive rewards. A user who staked for 1 second and a user who staked for 80 days will not get much more than the other so there is not enough incentive to stake for more if you are not going to participate in the voting.

## Vulnerability Detail
This is the `createPosition()` in `MlumStaking.sol`
```solidity
 function createPosition(
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 lockDuration
    ) external override nonReentrant {
        // no new lock can be set if the pool has been unlocked
        if (isUnlocked()) {
            require(lockDuration == 0, "locks disabled");
        }

        _updatePool();

        // handle tokens with transfer tax
        amount = _transferSupportingFeeOnTransfer(
            stakedToken,
            msg.sender,
            amount
        );
        require(amount != 0, "zero amount"); // createPosition: amount cannot be null

        // mint NFT position token
        uint256 currentTokenId = _mintNextTokenId(msg.sender);

        // calculate bonuses
        uint256 lockMultiplier = getMultiplierByLockDuration(lockDuration);

        uint256 amountWithMultiplier = (amount * (lockMultiplier + 1e4)) / 1e4;

        // create position

        _stakingPositions[currentTokenId] = StakingPosition({
>>          initialLockDuration: lockDuration,
            amount: amount,
            rewardDebt: (amountWithMultiplier * (_accRewardsPerShare)) /
                (PRECISION_FACTOR),
            lockDuration: lockDuration,
            startLockTime: _currentBlockTimestamp(),
            lockMultiplier: lockMultiplier,
            amountWithMultiplier: amountWithMultiplier,
            totalMultiplier: lockMultiplier
        });

        // update total lp supply
        _stakedSupply = _stakedSupply + amount;
        _stakedSupplyWithMultiplier =
            _stakedSupplyWithMultiplier +
            amountWithMultiplier;

        emit CreatePosition(currentTokenId, amount, lockDuration);
    }

```
As we can see there is no check about the `lockDuration`, so the `initialLockDuration` can be set to anything. The test below will show the difference between staking the same amount for 1 second and for 80 days.

Add the following test to `MlumStaking.t.sol`:
```solidity
 function testExploitTheRewards() public {
        _stakingToken.mint(ALICE, 1 ether);
        _stakingToken.mint(BOB, 1 ether);

        vm.startPrank(ALICE);
        _stakingToken.approve(address(_pool), 1 ether);
        _pool.createPosition(1 ether, 1 seconds);
        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.startPrank(BOB);
        _stakingToken.approve(address(_pool), 1 ether);
        _pool.createPosition(1 ether, 80 days);
        vm.stopPrank();

        _rewardToken.mint(address(_pool), 1000e6);

        vm.prank(ALICE);
        _pool.harvestPosition(1);

        vm.prank(BOB);
        _pool.harvestPosition(2);

        console.log("Balance of Alice: ", _rewardToken.balanceOf(ALICE));
        console.log("Balance of Bob: ", _rewardToken.balanceOf(BOB));
        //Balance of Alice:  410121806
        //Balance of Bob:    589878193
    }
```

## Impact
High because everyone can do this and just farm `rewardTokens` without having tokens staked for some days

## Recommendation
Add a minimum lock duration so it is fair for every user
