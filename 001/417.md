# Funds will be locked in BribeRewarder.sol

## Summary
Funds will be locked in BribeRewarder.sol

## Vulnerability Detail
User `receives` reward when they vote for a pool from `bribeRewarder` of that pool but there is an `edge` case where if there is `not` any vote for that pool then `funds` in bribeRewarder of that pool will stuck forever in the contract because there is not any function that allow withdraw of funds form bribeRewarder.sol
```solidity
 function fundAndBribe(uint256 startId, uint256 lastId, uint256 amountPerPeriod) external payable onlyOwner {
        IERC20 token = _token();
        uint256 totalAmount = _calcTotalAmount(startId, lastId, amountPerPeriod);

        if (address(token) == address(0)) {
            if (msg.value < totalAmount) {
                revert BribeRewarder__InsufficientFunds();
            }
        } else {
            token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), totalAmount);
        }

        _bribe(startId, lastId, amountPerPeriod);
    }
```
Reason:- Protocol assumes there always be voter voting for the pool but that may not be case, because it is possible there is no voter voted for the pool that bribeRewarder is rewarding and there is no withdraw() for owner to call and withdraw his funds in this case

## Impact
Loss of funds for the owner of the bribeRewarder
