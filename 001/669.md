# MasterChefV2.sol :: User will get incorrect reward when someone in the pool has called emergencyWithdrawal()

## Summary
User will get incorrect reward when someone in the pool has called emergencyWithdrawal()
## Vulnerability Detail

When a user wants to emergencyWithdraw from a pool , he calls `emergencyWithdraw(uint256 pid)`.
This will reduce the amount[userAccount] and the `totalAmount`.

But it is not updating the `reward.accDebtPerShare` and the `reward.lastUpdateTimestamp`  which causes other providers to earn incorrect reward since `reward.accDebtPerShare` depends on the `totalAmount`.

```solidity
    function emergencyWithdraw(uint256 pid) external override {
        //.. the rewards are lost from the lastUpdatedTime and in next time onwards it will calculate from scratch
        Farm storage farm = _farms[pid];

        uint256 balance = farm.amounts.getAmountOf(msg.sender);
        int256 deltaAmount = -balance.toInt256();

        farm.amounts.update(msg.sender, deltaAmount);
        //.. @audit farms reward needs to be updated using oldtotalSupply else other users will suffer reward loss. accRewardDebt is dependent on totalSupply.
        farm.token.safeTransfer(msg.sender, balance);

        emit PositionModified(pid, msg.sender, deltaAmount, 0);
    }
```    

We are not updating the farm.rewards when the totalSupply is reduced.

Next time when a user claims his reward from that pool , `getTotalRewards()` is called initially

```solidity
     function getTotalRewards(
       ....
    ) internal view returns (uint256) {
        if (totalSupply == 0) return 0;

        uint256 lastUpdateTimestamp = rewarder.lastUpdateTimestamp;
        uint256 timestamp = block.timestamp > endTimestamp ? endTimestamp : block.timestamp;

        return timestamp > lastUpdateTimestamp ? (timestamp - lastUpdateTimestamp) * rewardPerSecond : 0; 
    }
```
Here  `rewarder.lastUpdateTimestamp` is from the timestamp before the user has withdrawn in energency,
Hence `totalDeposit` value is used to calculate debtPershare form `rewarder.lastUpdateTimestamp` to current timestamp even tohugh `totalDeposited` is updated in the mid.


```solidity
  function getDebtPerShare(uint256 totalDeposit, uint256 totalRewards) internal pure returns (uint256) {
        return totalDeposit == 0 ? 0 : (totalRewards << Constants.ACC_PRECISION_BITS) / totalDeposit;
    }
```
