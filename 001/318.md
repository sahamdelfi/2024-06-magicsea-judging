# Voters cannot claim their rewards

## Summary
Let assume a bribe giver create a BribeRewarder from epoch 1 til epoch 3 and with reward amount 100 USDT for MLUM-IOTA pool after a while Alice allocates her vote power to the pool in first epoch and Bob allocate his vote power to the pool in second epoch since voters can claim their rewards in next epoch Bob has to wait til second epoch will be ended but when Bob calls claim function he get 0 reward in third epoch although his pending reward is greater than zero

## Vulnerability Detail
**Textual POC:**
when bribe giver calls fundAndBribe with startId=1 and lastId=3 and amountPerPeriod = 100e6 _startVotingPeriod will be 1 and _lastVotingPeriod will be 3 and when Bob calls claim function in third epoch endPeriod will be 2 and we have two iterate in our loop in first iterate Bob doesn't participate in voting and he doesn't have reward but this causes _lastUpdateTimestamp will be updated to block.timestamp and in second iterate Bob's reward will be zero because timestamp - lastUpdateTimestamp is zero hence Bob loses his reward

**Coded POC:**
Add this lines to setUp function
```diff

+ RewarderFactory _rewardFactory;
function setUp()public {
...
+ address factoryImpl = address(new RewarderFactory());

+        _rewardFactory = RewarderFactory(
+           address(
+                new TransparentUpgradeableProxy2Step(
+                    factoryImpl, ProxyAdmin2Step(address(1)), abi.encodeWithSelector(RewarderFactory.initialize.selector, DEV, 
+ _rewardType, _rewarder)
+                )
+           )
+        );
```
```solidity
    function testVotersCannotClaimTheirRewards() public {
        ERC20Mock pool = new ERC20Mock("lp","LP", 18);
        ERC20Mock usdt = new ERC20Mock("USDT","USDT", 6);
        usdt.mint(address(this), 300e6);

        IBribeRewarder _bribeRewarder1 = _rewardFactory.createBribeRewarder(usdt, address(pool));
    
        _createPosition(ALICE);
        _createPosition(BOB);

        
        usdt.approve(address(_bribeRewarder1), 300e6);
        _bribeRewarder1.fundAndBribe(1, 3, 100e6);
        //start first epoch
        vm.prank(DEV);
        _voter.startNewVotingPeriod();
        address[] memory pools = new address[](1);
        pools[0] = address(pool);

        
        vm.prank(ALICE);
        _voter.vote(1, pools, _getDeltaAmounts());

        skip(14 days);
        //end of first epoch
        //start second epoch
        vm.prank(DEV);
        _voter.startNewVotingPeriod();
        vm.prank(BOB);
        _voter.vote(2, pools, _getDeltaAmounts());

        //end of second epoch
        skip(14 days);
        assertEq(_bribeRewarder1.getPendingReward(2), 99187199);
        vm.prank(BOB);
        _bribeRewarder1.claim(2);
        assertEq(usdt.balanceOf(BOB), 0);// BOB reward is zero
    }
```


## Impact
Voters lose their reward
