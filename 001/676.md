# ```vote``` function does not correctly checks if the remaining duration of a ```LockingPosition``` is greater than 14 days.

## Vulnerability Detail
When a user has a ```LockingPosition``` and wants to to vote, according to [docs](https://docs.magicsea.finance/protocol/magic/magic-lum-voting), "the remaining lock period needs to be longer then the epoch time". However, the checks in ```vote``` function is like this :
```solidity
    function vote(uint256 tokenId, address[] calldata pools, uint256[] calldata deltaAmounts) external {
        // ...

        // check if _minimumLockTime >= initialLockDuration and it is locked
@>        if (_mlumStaking.getStakingPosition(tokenId).initialLockDuration < _minimumLockTime) {
            revert IVoter__InsufficientLockTime();
        }
@>        if (_mlumStaking.getStakingPosition(tokenId).lockDuration < _periodDuration) {
            revert IVoter__InsufficientLockTime();
        }

        // ...
    }
```
As we can see, the function checks if the ```lockDuration``` is greater than the ```_periodDuration``` which is 14 days. However, the ```lockDuration``` of the ```LockingPosition``` can indeed be greater than the 14 days but the remaining lock time to be actually seconds. 

## Impact
This vulnerability leads to someone to be actually to double vote since he can vote with a ```LockingPosition``` which has remaining lock time some seconds and then withdraw his staked MLUM and stake them again and vote again. Also, the invariant of the protocol that "the remaining lock period needs to be longer then the epoch time" is not enforced.

## Recommendation
Consider checking that the remaining lock periods is longer than 14 days by using the block.timestamp.
