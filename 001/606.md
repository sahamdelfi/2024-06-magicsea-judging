# Wrong value of amount to add is used in addToPosition()

## Summary
When FoT is used there is a discrepancy with how avg Duration is calculated

## Vulnerability Detail
When FoTs are used, the pre-taxed amount is added to already taxed amount when calculating averages and assigning current lockDuration, so Users that expect no incosistency in calculation and expect  that pre-taxed amount won't be added to taxed amount will get longer lockDuration than expected.
Let me give an exmaple of pre-tax value  using the formula in the contract, it will be very simple 
`uint256 avgDuration = (remainingLockTime * position.amount + amountToAdd * position.initialLockDuration)
            / (position.amount + amountToAdd);`
remainingLockTime = 2 days ;   position.amount = 5;   amountToAdd = 10;  initialLockDuration = 100 days;   
Subtituting that gives =  (2 * 5 + 10 * 100)/ (10+15) gives 40 days as avgDuration 

Let's subtitute it taxed (10%  tax) = (2 * 5 + 9 * 100)/ (10+15) gives 36 days as avgDuration 

There is a 4 days as seen 

## Impact
Users that expect consistency across all calculations will get higher lock value than expected hence funds are locked longer than expected because some state updates are made before the tokens are taxed,  as opposed to createPosition() the funds are transerred first and taxed before any state update is made. Same logic should apply both places.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
First perform the transfer from user to contract before any state changes are made.

This can't be design choice as it wasn't liosted as known issue as this is obviusly an issue that needs to be addressed.
