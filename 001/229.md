# A malicious user can fill the maximum bribe limit to sabotage pool voting

## Summary
A malicious user can create 5 bribes with fake ERC20 to fill up the `_bribesPerPriod` sabotaging the creation of real ones.

## Vulnerability Detail
Bribes can be created for every pool as incentive for users to vote for the pool. There is no restriction on who can create bribes for a pool and what to be the reward token. 
```js
    function createBribeRewarder(IERC20 token, address pool) external returns (IBribeRewarder rewarder) {
        rewarder = IBribeRewarder(_cloneBribe(RewarderType.BribeRewarder, token, pool));

        emit BribeRewarderCreated(RewarderType.BribeRewarder, token, pool, rewarder);
    }
```
After the bribe is created, it needs to be registered, so on vote users can deposit into it and earn rewards. 
However, the problem is there is a limitation of only 5 bribes per pool. A malicious user can simply create 5 fake bribes to fill up the `_bribesPerPriod` sabotaging the creation of real ones.

```js
   function onRegister() external override {
        IBribeRewarder rewarder = IBribeRewarder(msg.sender);

        _checkRegisterCaller(rewarder);

        uint256 currentPeriodId = _currentVotingPeriodId;
        (address pool, uint256[] memory periods) = rewarder.getBribePeriods();
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < periods.length; ++i) {
            // TODO check if rewarder token + pool  is already registered

            require(periods[i] >= currentPeriodId, "wrong period");
            require(_bribesPerPriod[periods[i]][pool].length + 1 <= Constants.MAX_BRIBES_PER_POOL, "too much bribes");
            _bribesPerPriod[periods[i]][pool].push(rewarder);
        }
    }
```
## Impact
It breaks the whole functionality of bribes because users will vote but won't get a reward or users won't vote for this pool, so if you want to sabotage pool voting, you can create fake bribes.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a whitelist of ERC20 tokens that can be used as reward tokens and also add a minimum reward funding.
