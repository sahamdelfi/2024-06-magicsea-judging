# a user can use the previous  lockMultiplier even after the lock time is expired

## Summary
a user can use **MlumStaking.addToPosition** to lock  again with the previous lock multiplier but with small **lockduration** 

## Vulnerability Detail
In `MlumStaking.addToPosition`, the `position.lockMultiplier` is directly derived from the `position.initialLockDuration`. Also, the **lockDuration** of the new lock is calculated based on the remaining duration of the previous lock with the previous amount:

```solidity
uint256 avgDuration = (remainingLockTime * position.amount + amountToAdd * position.initialLockDuration)
            / (position.amount + amountToAdd);
```

The **remainingLockTime** is based on the position being added to. If the position has already expired, **remainingLockTime** will be zero. So, when calculating the **avgDuration**, we are multiplying `(0 * position.amount + amountToAdd * position.initialLockDuration)`, which simplifies to `(amountToAdd * position.initialLockDuration) / (position.amount + amountToAdd)`. This results in a small duration. However, since `position.lockMultiplier` is `getMultiplierByLockDuration(position.initialLockDuration)`, the user can get the same lock multiplier with a small lock duration.
## Impact
A user can get a big lock multiplier with a small duration. For example, if the user locks for the first time with a _maxLockDuration of 1 year and gets the _maxLockMultiplier, after 1 year they can use the addToPosition function to lock for a shorter duration but still get the maxLockMultiplier, even if the lock expires.

## Recommendation

if the lock expire calculate the  lock multiplier with the new lock duration
