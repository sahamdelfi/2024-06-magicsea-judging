# Possible stuck of funds in BribeRewarder.sol

## Summary
If there is a bribe for a voting period but no one votes in it, the reward money will be stuck in the contract since there is no way to withdraw it.

## Vulnerability Detail
To incentivize voting for a pool, bribe rewards are created. Rewarder decides for how many voting periods there would be bribes by setting bribe `startId` and `lastId`. If he decides he wants to bribe for 5 periods, the funds for rewards are divided into 5 and voters get them after each voting period. This problem is if no one votes for the pool for that bribe period, the rewards for this period will stay in the contract. 

For example, if there is only one bribe for period 1 and no one votes in this voting period, that money cannot be used for future bribes and cannot be withdrawn from the rewarder.

Another possible scenario of stuck money is if the rewarder creates bribes for 5 periods and there are only 4 voting periods. The funds for the last period will never be distributed for a user and the rewarder can't withdraw them.
