# Voters may lose their bribe rewards if reward tokens belong to some special tokens

## Summary
Some tokens (e.g., cUSDCv3) contain a special case for amount == type(uint256).max in their transfer functions that results in only the user's balance being transferred. This will cause the actual amount may far less than the expected amount.

## Vulnerability Detail
In BribeRewarder, the owner can start to bribe via `fundAndBribe`. And the contact add the check to make sure that the owner has already transferred expected amount to the contract. The tokens will be distributed to the voters.
```c
    function fundAndBribe(uint256 startId, uint256 lastId, uint256 amountPerPeriod) external payable onlyOwner {
        IERC20 token = _token();
        uint256 totalAmount = _calcTotalAmount(startId, lastId, amountPerPeriod);

        if (address(token) == address(0)) {
            if (msg.value < totalAmount) {
                revert BribeRewarder__InsufficientFunds();
            }
        } else {
            token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), totalAmount);
        }

        _bribe(startId, lastId, amountPerPeriod);
    }
```
There are some special tokens(cUSDCv3). When we transfer `amount == type(uint256).max`, the actual amount is the balance of the account. This may lead to the actual token amount in the contract may far less than the expected amount. Voters may not claim their rewards because there is no enough balance.

## Impact
Voters may not claim their rewards.

## Recommendation
Check the actual received token amount and make sure the actual received token amount should be equal or larger than expected amount.
