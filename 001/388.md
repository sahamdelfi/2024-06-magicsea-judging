# Users could become unable to claim their rewards through `BribeRewarder`, if they leave them unclaimed for long enough

## Summary
If users don't call `BribeRewarder::claim` for long enough, their rewards could get stuck, due exceeding the gas limit when `BribeRewarder::claim` is called

## Vulnerability Detail
Lets say Bob calls `Voter::vote` for current period and deposits votes into a `BribeRewarder` trough `Voter::_notifyBribes` and `BribeRewarder::deposit`.
```solidity
function vote(uint256 tokenId, address[] calldata pools, uint256[] calldata deltaAmounts) external {

        .....

            _notifyBribes(_currentVotingPeriodId, pool, tokenId, deltaAmount); // msg.sender, deltaAmount);

        .....

    }

function _notifyBribes(uint256 periodId, address pool, uint256 tokenId, uint256 deltaAmount) private {

        .....

                rewarders[i].deposit(periodId, tokenId, deltaAmount);

        .....

    }
```
Now Bob is going to be able to claim his rewards from this voting period every time he want, as long as the current period is over, not exactly. As we can see when `BribeRewarder::claim` is executed the function calls `BribeRewarder::_modify` multiple times. The number of that times is based on `LatestFinishedPeriod - _startVotingPeriod + 1`. If this number get's big enough, the `BribeRewarder::claim` could be able to face `out of gas` error, due to too many `BribeRewarder::_modify` executions.
```solidity
function claim(uint256 tokenId) external override {
        uint256 endPeriod = IVoter(_caller).getLatestFinishedPeriod();

        uint256 totalAmount;

        // calc emission per period cause every period can every other durations
        for (uint256 i = _startVotingPeriod; i <= endPeriod; ++i) {
            totalAmount += _modify(i, tokenId, 0, true);
        }

        emit Claimed(tokenId, _pool(), totalAmount);
    }
```

## Impact
Rewarder's funds get stuck

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
```diff
`endPeriod` shouldn't be `LatestFinishedPeriod` if it is bigger than `_lastVotingPeriod` from the given BribeRewarder
function claim(uint256 tokenId) external override {
        uint256 endPeriod = IVoter(_caller).getLatestFinishedPeriod();
+++     endPeriod = endPeriod < _lastVotingPeriod ? endPeriod : _lastVotingPeriod;

        uint256 totalAmount;

        // calc emission per period cause every period can every other durations
        for (uint256 i = _startVotingPeriod; i <= endPeriod; ++i) {
            totalAmount += _modify(i, tokenId, 0, true);
        }

        emit Claimed(tokenId, _pool(), totalAmount);
    }
```
