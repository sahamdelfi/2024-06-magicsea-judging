# Improperly configured `_requireOnlyOperatorOrOwnerOf` function

## Summary
The `_requireOnlyOperatorOrOwnerOf` function is improperly inconfigured. Rather than only allowing the operator and owner of the token id, it allows everyone instead.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `_requireOnlyOperatorOrOwnerOf` is used to check if the caller has privileged rights to the NFT. The function calls `_isAuthorized` in ERC721Upgradeable.sol incorrectly passing in msg.sender as both owner as spender.
```solidity
    /**
     * @dev Check if a userAddress has privileged rights on a spNFT
     */
    function _requireOnlyOperatorOrOwnerOf(uint256 tokenId) internal view {
        // isApprovedOrOwner: caller has no rights on token
        require(ERC721Upgradeable._isAuthorized(msg.sender, msg.sender, tokenId), "FORBIDDEN");
    }
```
However, the `_isAuthorized` function doesn't verify that the `owner` parameter is the actual `owner` of the NFT, and also returns true if `owner` == `spender.
```solidity
    /**
     * @dev Returns whether `spender` is allowed to manage `owner`'s tokens, or `tokenId` in
     * particular (ignoring whether it is owned by `owner`).
     *
     * WARNING: This function assumes that `owner` is the actual owner of `tokenId` and does not verify this
     * assumption.
     */
    function _isAuthorized(address owner, address spender, uint256 tokenId) internal view virtual returns (bool) {
        return
            spender != address(0) &&
            (owner == spender || isApprovedForAll(owner, spender) || _getApproved(tokenId) == spender);
    }
```
## Impact
As a result, any call to functions protected by `_requireOnlyOperatorOrOwnerOf` can be accessed by anyone, and not the operator or owner as intended.

## Recommendation

Check for the token owner first, then check if msg.sender is an approved operator for the owner instead.
