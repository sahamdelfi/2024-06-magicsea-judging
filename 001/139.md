# Funds are `locked` forever in BribeRewarder, when `no` user voted for that pool

## Summary
Funds are `locked` forever in BribeRewarder, when `no` user voted for that pool, because there is no way to recover those funds

## Vulnerability Detail
When a bribeRewarder is created, it takes the `full` rewardAmount for bribe `upfront`, calculating from `startId` to `lastId`
```solidity
function fundAndBribe(uint256 startId, uint256 lastId, uint256 amountPerPeriod) external payable onlyOwner {
        IERC20 token = _token();
        uint256 totalAmount = _calcTotalAmount(startId, lastId, amountPerPeriod);

        if (address(token) == address(0)) {
       @>   if (msg.value < totalAmount) {
                revert BribeRewarder__InsufficientFunds();
            }
        } else {
      @>   token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), totalAmount);
        }
        _bribe(startId, lastId, amountPerPeriod);
    }
```
Now there can be situations when there is `no` user voted for that `pool`, so there will be no `reward` distribution. Now the problem is there is not `any` function() to `recover` those funds, causing complete `loss` of funds to owner of the bribeRewarder.
Also owner `can't` change startId or lastId for future voting period

Eg:- Suppose owner of bribeRewarder created & funded for startId = 3 to lastId = 5  at 100e18 amountPerPeriod for poolA ie 300e18 rewardToken is transfered from owner to bribeRewarder. But no user voted for poolA for any votingPeriod starting form 3 to 5. Then owner should withdraw his funds but can't as no way to do it, also owner can't increase/change the startId to future as there are checks to prevent that.

## Impact
Funds will be locked forever, when no user voted for that pool

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Make a withdraw() to recover funds only incase when there are no voters
