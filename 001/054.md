# in `BribeRewarder._bribe()` empty zero-initialized elements are pushed  into the _rewards array, loss of rewards

## Summary

Doing  `_rewards.push();` creates a new zero-initialized element in the `_rewards` array.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `BribeRewarder._bribe()` when creating rewards per period,  `_rewards.push();`  is done

```solidity
        _amountPerPeriod = amountPerPeriod;

        // create rewads per period
        uint256 bribeEpochs = _calcPeriods(startId, lastId);
        for (uint256 i = 0; i <= bribeEpochs; ++i) {
            _rewards.push();//@audit empty zero-initialized elements are pushed into the rewards array
        }

```

The issue here is that doing  `_rewards.push()` creates a new zero-initialized element in the `_rewards` array So there's no pending reward  to get via `BribeRewarder.getPendingReward()` as there will be no data in the `_rewards` array. 

The syntax to use push() to add _x_ to an array  is   `arrayName.push(x);`, doing  arrayName.push(); will add 0 to the array instead of x.

This also affect fundAndBribe() function as the funds received are never accounted for in _rewards array.

SO when users attempt to call `BribeRewarder.getPendingReward()` accounted balance and totalSupply will always be 0 and `reward.rewarder` will always be address(0).. this will cause issues for `BribeRewarder.getPendingReward()`.

_bribe() is the only function through which `_rewards` array is updated in BribeRewarder.sol




## Impact
- loss of rewards 

- `BribeRewarder.getPendingReward()` will have issues as the _rewards array will have empty zero-initialised data

## Recommendation

In `BribeRewarder._bribe()` properly update the `_rewards` array
