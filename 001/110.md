# Users might not be able to claim bribe rewards

## Summary

The [`claim`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/rewarders/BribeRewarder.sol#L153-L164) function of the `BribeRewarder` contract can lead to denial of service if users delay claiming rewards for many periods or if there's a large gap between `_startVotingPeriod` and `endPeriod`. The function's loop through each period, including those without rewards, can cause out-of-gas errors

## Vulnerability Detail

The [`claim`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/rewarders/BribeRewarder.sol#L153-L164)  function of the `BribeRewarder` contract allows users to claim bribe rewards for voting. The function loops from `_startVotingPeriod` until the last finished period. This can cause issues if a user does not claim rewards for multiple periods after bribing finishes or if the difference between `_startVotingPeriod` and `endPeriod` is large enough to lead to a denial of service condition, as the `_modify` function must be executed for periods where there is no reward.

**Issue Scenario 1:**

1. The `BribeRewarder` has start and end periods set to 1-10 (10 periods).
2. The user votes and accumulates rewards.
3. The user does not claim rewards for multiple periods after bribing finishes.
4. The last finished period is 30.
5. The user tries to claim rewards but is unable to due to an out-of-gas error, as the loop in the `claim` function iterates from 1 to the last finished period (30), executing the `_modify` logic for all of them.

**Issue Scenario 2:**

1. The `BribeRewarder` has start and end periods set to 1-30 (30 periods).
2. The user votes and accumulates rewards.
3. The user does not claim rewards until bribing finishes.
4. The last finished period is 30.
5. The user tries to claim rewards but is unable to due to an out-of-gas error, as the loop needs to iterate over 30 periods, executing the `_modify` logic for each.

## Impact

User might be unable to claim accumulated bribe rewards.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to add pagination to the `claim` function to allow users to claim partial rewards. In addition, the loop should be capped at the `_lastVotingPeriod`.
