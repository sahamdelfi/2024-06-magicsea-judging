# Position's rewards might be lost

## Summary
When a position is harvested, it might not have enough balance to send rewards to the user. It will send as many as it can and the rest of the position's rewards will be lost.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `_harvestPosition` function is called in order to send the position's rewards to the user. It checks if the position has pending rewards, and if it has it proceeds to call `_safeRewardTransfer`. The `_safeRewardTransfer` function checks if the contract's current balance of reward tokens is sufficient to send the rewards to the user. If the balance is not enough, it will send as many tokens as it currently has (even zero tokens) and will reset user's rewardDebt, marking the rewards as paid in full.

Functions that call both `_harvestPosition` and `_updateBoostMultiplierInfoAndRewardDebt` to collect reward and reset rewardDebt:
1. `addToPosition`
2. `harvestPosition`
3. `harvestPositionTo`
4. `harvestPositionsTo`
5. `withdrawFromPosition`
6. `renewLockPosition`
7. `extendLockPosition`

## Impact
If the contract runs out of rewards, any user trying to collect his position's rewards will incur losses to his position's rewards, as the
position's rewardDebt will reset while receiving zero reward tokens.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Introduce a new member to `StakingPosition` struct that stores the `lostRewards` of a position.
