# The first staker may use flashloan to dos contract

## Summary
AccRewardsPerShare will continue to increase as the prize pool accumulates.The amount it increases depends on the _stakedSupplyWithMultiplier.  
The first staker can control the value of _stakedSupplyWithMultiplier to be very small, and then use flashloans to continuously increase AccRewardsPerShare until AccRewardsPerShare becomes large, which may lead to computational overflow and cause the contract to fail to run.
## Vulnerability Detail
1. The first staker calls createPosition to create a position, where the control pledging amount amount and multiplier amountWithMultiplier are both 1
```solidity
    function createPosition(uint256 amount, uint256 lockDuration) external override nonReentrant {
```
2.  The first staker uses flashloan to lend a large number of rewardToken injection contracts, and then calls updatePool()
```solidity
    function updatePool() external nonReentrant {
```
3. At this point, the accruedReward is very large and the stackedSupplyWithMultiplier is very small (set to 1), and the accRewardsPerShare will increase significantly
```solidity
        _accRewardsPerShare =
            accRewardsPerShare + ((accruedReward * (PRECISION_FACTOR)) / (_stakedSupplyWithMultiplier));
```
4. Since there is currently only one staker in the pool, he can immediately call HarvestPosition to obtain all the reward tokens
```solidity
        uint256 pending = position.amountWithMultiplier * _accRewardsPerShare / PRECISION_FACTOR - position.rewardDebt;
```
5. Then it can open a new position, repeat the above process, and ultimately, turn AccRewardsPerShare into a large value, which will overflow the calculation and cause the contract to fail to run
## Impact

The contract will be  DOS

```solidity
    function _updatePool() internal {
        uint256 accRewardsPerShare = _accRewardsPerShare;
        uint256 rewardBalance = rewardToken.balanceOf(address(this));
        uint256 lastRewardBalance = _lastRewardBalance;

        // recompute accRewardsPerShare if not up to date
        if (lastRewardBalance == rewardBalance || _stakedSupply == 0) {
            return;
        }

        uint256 accruedReward = rewardBalance - lastRewardBalance;
        _accRewardsPerShare =
            accRewardsPerShare + ((accruedReward * (PRECISION_FACTOR)) / (_stakedSupplyWithMultiplier));

        _lastRewardBalance = rewardBalance;

        emit PoolUpdated(_currentBlockTimestamp(), accRewardsPerShare);
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Set a minimum staking amount and shortest staking time to increase the cost of this attack
```solidity
uint256 minStakingAmount;
uint256 minLockDuration;
    function createPosition(uint256 amount, uint256 lockDuration) external override nonReentrant {
        // no new lock can be set if the pool has been unlocked
        if (isUnlocked()) {
            require(lockDuration == 0, "locks disabled");
        }
       if(amount < mainStakingAmount){
            revert()
       }
       if(lockDuration < minLockDuration){
            revert()
       }
        ...
    }
```
