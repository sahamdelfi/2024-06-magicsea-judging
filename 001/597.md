# rewardToken.balanceOf(address(this)) can be altered by anyone and harvesting Rewards can be halted in MlumStaking.sol

## Summary
 
The reward tranfer in  MlumStaking.sol can be halted in case the reward amount > rewardBalance.

## Vulnerability Detail

```Solidity
    function harvestPosition(uint256 tokenId) external override nonReentrant {
        _requireOnlyApprovedOrOwnerOf(tokenId);

        _updatePool();
        _harvestPosition(tokenId, ERC721Upgradeable.ownerOf(tokenId));
        _updateBoostMultiplierInfoAndRewardDebt(_stakingPositions[tokenId]);
    }
```
 ```Solidity
   function _harvestPosition(uint256 tokenId, address to) internal {
        StakingPosition storage position = _stakingPositions[tokenId];

        // compute position's pending rewards
        uint256 pending = position.amountWithMultiplier * _accRewardsPerShare / PRECISION_FACTOR - position.rewardDebt;

        // transfer rewards
        if (pending > 0) {
            // send rewards
            _safeRewardTransfer(to, pending);
        }
        emit HarvestPosition(tokenId, to, pending);
    }
```
```Solidity
    function _safeRewardTransfer(address _to, uint256 _amount) internal {
        uint256 rewardBalance = rewardToken.balanceOf(address(this));

        if (_amount > rewardBalance) {
            _lastRewardBalance = _lastRewardBalance - rewardBalance;
            rewardToken.safeTransfer(_to, rewardBalance);
        } else {
            _lastRewardBalance = _lastRewardBalance - _amount;
            rewardToken.safeTransfer(_to, _amount);
        }
    }
```

In MlumStaking.sol , harvestPosition calculated the rewards and sends them to the owner, and in _safeRewardTransfer(), the reward balance is checked by uint256 rewardBalance = rewardToken.balanceOf(address(this)); This can be altered by anyone by transfering rewardTokens to the contract address, which can cause the rewardBalance to be greater than _lastRewardBalance .

Consider initial state where rewardToken.balanceOf(address(this)) = 100 and _lastRewardBalance = 100

Execution of harvestPosition():

_updatePool() is called and finds no need to update _accRewardsPerShare because rewardToken.balanceOf(address(this)) equals _lastRewardBalance.
_harvestPosition() calculates the pending rewards and calls _safeRewardTransfer() with _amount calculated.

External Interference:

Before _safeRewardTransfer() executes its check, an external transaction (e.g., another user or a contract) sends additional rewards to address(this) such that rewardToken.balanceOf(address(this)) = 150.

Execution of _safeRewardTransfer() Check:

Now rewardToken.balanceOf(address(this)) is 150, while _lastRewardBalance is still 100.

This will be an issue if the reward amount is high , then  _lastRewardBalance = _lastRewardBalance - rewardBalance; will revert
and also the _lastRewardBalance will be updated incorrectly which will cause future calculation vulnerabilities.

## Impact

Wrong calculation of _lastRewardBalance and prone to halting reward harvesting of users.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use a new variable totalRewardBalance , and use it instead of rewardToken.balanceOf(address(this)) and use a depositReward function for depositing rewards.
