# Voter.sol#vote - Users can continue voting after their `lockDuration` expire

## Summary
Users can continue using their staking after the `lockDuration` expire.

## Vulnerability Detail
Users create positions by staking their money. With their position, they can vote for pools and earn rewards. Users can only vote for their `lockDuration` time. When their duration expires, they can withdraw their money or extend the `lockDuration` of their staking to continue participating in voting periods. They should **NOT** be able to vote for pools if their `lockDuration` expires. However, there is no check to prevent voting with expired duration.

## PoC
Paste the following test in `Voter.t.sol`
```js
   function testVotingWithoutLockDuration() public {
        _stakingToken.mint(ALICE, 2 ether);

        vm.startPrank(ALICE);
        _stakingToken.approve(address(_pool), 1 ether);
        _pool.createPosition(1 ether, 100 days);
        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 101 days);

        vm.prank(DEV);

        _voter.startNewVotingPeriod();

        vm.startPrank(ALICE);
        _voter.vote(1, _getDummyPools(), _getDeltaAmounts());

        assertLt(_pool.getStakingPosition(1).lockDuration, block.timestamp);
    }

```
## Impact
Users can vote with expired staking.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Before voting ensure the `lockDuration` is more than the `block.timestamp`.
```js
        if (_mlumStaking.getStakingPosition(tokenId).lockDuration < block.timestamp) {
            revert IVoter__InsufficientLockTime();
        }
```
