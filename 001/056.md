# Anyone can create bribe rewarder.

## Summary
`RewarderFactory.sol#createBribeRewarder` doesn't check if caller is owner.
Therefore, attacker can create bribe rewarders many times as he/she wants and then register them to the Voter contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
`RewarderFactory.sol#createBribeRewarder` function is the following.
```solidity
    function createBribeRewarder(IERC20 token, address pool) external returns (IBribeRewarder rewarder) {
        rewarder = IBribeRewarder(_cloneBribe(RewarderType.BribeRewarder, token, pool));

        emit BribeRewarderCreated(RewarderType.BribeRewarder, token, pool, rewarder);
    }
```
As can be seen, since it doesn't check if msg.sender is owner, attacker can create bribe rewarders many times as he/she wants and then register them to the Voter contract.

`Voter.sol#onRegister` function is the following.
```solidity
    function onRegister() external override {
        IBribeRewarder rewarder = IBribeRewarder(msg.sender);

        _checkRegisterCaller(rewarder);

        uint256 currentPeriodId = _currentVotingPeriodId;
        (address pool, uint256[] memory periods) = rewarder.getBribePeriods();
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < periods.length; ++i) {
            // TODO check if rewarder token + pool  is already registered @audit-info no implementation 

            require(periods[i] >= currentPeriodId, "wrong period");
141:        require(_bribesPerPriod[periods[i]][pool].length + 1 <= Constants.MAX_BRIBES_PER_POOL, "too much bribes");
            _bribesPerPriod[periods[i]][pool].push(rewarder);
        }
    }
```
As can be seen, the maximum count of bribes per pool is limited to `MAX_BRIBES_PER_POOL = 5`.
So, if the attacker create 5 fake bribe rewarders and register them to the voter, administrator can't register normal bribe rewarder to the Voter contract.

## Impact
An attacker can prevent administrator from registering bribe rewarders to the Voter contract.
As a result, voters cannot receive bribes.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Modify the `RewardFactory.sol#createBribeRewarder` function as follows.
```solidity
    function createBribeRewarder(IERC20 token, address pool) external returns (IBribeRewarder rewarder) {
+       _checkOwner();
        rewarder = IBribeRewarder(_cloneBribe(RewarderType.BribeRewarder, token, pool));

        emit BribeRewarderCreated(RewarderType.BribeRewarder, token, pool, rewarder);
    }
```
