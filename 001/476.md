# BribeRewarder.deposit Reverts

## Summary

`BribeRewarder._modify()` is an internal function responsible for depositing/withdrawing, calculating rewards, and harvesting. In BribeRewarder, it is used twice: by the `deposit` function and the `claim` function. However, **the deposit function always reverts**.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `deposit` function executes an `onlyVoter` modifier that does the following:

```solidity
    function _checkVoter() internal view virtual {
        if (msg.sender != address(_caller)) {
            revert BribeRewarder__OnlyVoter();
        }
    }
```

This means that deposit can only be called by `_caller`.

On the other hand, within the `_modify` function, we have the following condition:

```solidity
        if (!IVoter(_caller).ownerOf(tokenId, msg.sender)) {
            revert BribeRewarder__NotOwner();
        }
```

This requires that, to avoid reverting, the owner of the `tokenId` must be the contract at the `_caller` address, which does not make sense.

## Impact

The `deposit` call can only revert.

## Recommendation

Properly check who the owner of the `tokenId` is by passing an additional parameter.
