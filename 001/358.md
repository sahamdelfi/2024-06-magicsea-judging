# The staker might not get paid for expected rewards

## Summary
In case of the reward balance left less than pending rewards for a staker, the staker can't get rewarded for the remained pending rewards even after reward token re-transfer by MlumStaking contract owner.

## Vulnerability Detail
According to lines 742 ~ 745 in MlumStaking.sol, if pendingRewards > rewardBalance, only remained reward balance would be sent to staker, and then in the line 667, rewardDebt is set to `position.amountWithMultiplier * _accRewardsPerShare / PRECISION_FACTOR`, which means that in the protocol the mis-harvested pendingRewards is not realized.

In the next harvest after reward token charged again in contract,  the above mis-harvested rewards is not paid for the staker.

## Impact
The staker might not get paid for the expected rewards

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It needs to subtract the mis-harvested pending rewards (`_amount - rewardBalance`) from `position.rewardDebt`
