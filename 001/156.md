# Users are able to block bribing in pools for any voting period

## Summary
Users are able to block `BribeRewarder::_bribe` in pools for any voting period, by creating and register their own BribeRewarders to reach the limit with.

## Vulnerability Detail
As we can see, nothing stops mistrustful user from creating their own BribeRewarder from `RewarderFactory`
```solidity
function createBribeRewarder(IERC20 token, address pool) external returns (IBribeRewarder rewarder) { 
     rewarder = IBribeRewarder(_cloneBribe(RewarderType.BribeRewarder, token, pool)); 
  
     emit BribeRewarderCreated(RewarderType.BribeRewarder, token, pool, rewarder); 
 } 

 function _cloneBribe(RewarderType rewarderType, IERC20 token, address pool) 
     private 
     returns (IBribeRewarder rewarder) 
 { 
     if (rewarderType != RewarderType.BribeRewarder) revert RewarderFactory__InvalidRewarderType(); 
  
     IRewarder implementation = _implementations[rewarderType]; 
  
     if (address(implementation) == address(0)) revert RewarderFactory__ZeroAddress(); 
  
     IRewarder[] storage rewarders = _rewarders[rewarderType]; 
  
     bytes memory immutableData = abi.encodePacked(token, pool); 
     bytes32 salt = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, _nonces[msg.sender]++)); 
  
     rewarder = IBribeRewarder(ImmutableClone.cloneDeterministic(address(implementation), immutableData, salt)); 
  
     rewarders.push(rewarder); 
     _rewarderTypes[rewarder] = rewarderType; 
  
     rewarder.initialize(msg.sender); 
 } 
```
However, there is scenario where malicious actor could create 5 BribeRewareders(MAX_BRIBES_PER_POOL = 5), fund them and call bribe for as many periods as he want in the future with dustAmount inputed(funded amount should be >= totalAmount). Due to the `Voter::onRegister` call, actor's BribeRewarders will be recorded in `Voter::_bribesPerPriod` for the specified periods and pool address by reaching the maximum limit

```solidity
function onRegister() external override {
        IBribeRewarder rewarder = IBribeRewarder(msg.sender);

        _checkRegisterCaller(rewarder);

        uint256 currentPeriodId = _currentVotingPeriodId;
        (address pool, uint256[] memory periods) = rewarder.getBribePeriods();
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < periods.length; ++i) {
            // TODO check if rewarder token + pool  is already registered

            require(periods[i] >= currentPeriodId, "wrong period");
            require(_bribesPerPriod[periods[i]][pool].length + 1 <= Constants.MAX_BRIBES_PER_POOL, "too much bribes");
            _bribesPerPriod[periods[i]][pool].push(rewarder);
        }
    }
```
Because of this actions and `MAX_BRIBES_PER_POOL` limit reached, protocol users won't be able to bribe voters for the blocked voting periods 
## Impact
1. Core Invariant broke, protocol users could be blocked from bribe rewards into voting pools
2. Voters' rewards would be 0 or dust amounts

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider making that only trusted users are able create and register new `BribeRewarders` or increase `MAX_BRIBES_PER_POOL` to make blocking periods unworthy for attackers
