# Incorrect check of ownerOf for tokenId during voting

## Summary
Incorrect check of `ownerOf` for `tokenId` during voting.

## Vulnerability Detail
After the votes are cast, users get rewarded as the `_notifyBribes` function calls the `deposit` function of the `BribeRewarder` contract, if the rbribe eward contract exists for the current period and pool. The `deposit` function first checks if the caller is the `Voter` contract through the `onlyVoter` modifier, which is true.

```solidity
function deposit(uint256 periodId, uint256 tokenId, uint256 deltaAmount) public onlyVoter {
        _modify(periodId, tokenId, deltaAmount.toInt256(), false);

        emit Deposited(periodId, tokenId, _pool(), deltaAmount);
    }
```

After that, in the `_modify` function, it is checked if the `msg.sender (Voter contract)` is the owner of the token, which is false because when the original owner of the token votes, he does not transfer his token to the `Voter` contract. This requirement will fail and the whole transaction will revert, blocking voting for the current period and pool and preventing the owner of the token of the extra bribe reward.

```solidity
    function _modify(uint256 periodId, uint256 tokenId, int256 deltaAmount, bool isPayOutReward)
        private
        returns (uint256 rewardAmount)
    {   

        //@audit-issue H1: msg.sender is Voter contract, which is not owner
        // of tokenId and this check will always fail
        if (!IVoter(_caller).ownerOf(tokenId, msg.sender)) {
            revert BribeRewarder__NotOwner();
        }

        // ... 
    }
```
## Impact
Blocking the voting and receiving the extra bribe reward.

```solidity
if (!IVoter(_caller).ownerOf(tokenId, msg.sender)) {
            revert BribeRewarder__NotOwner();
        }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The original caller of the transaction should be checked in the `_modify` function to see if they own the given `tokenId`.
