# `_maxLockMultiplier` is set to a value exceeding `MAX_LOCK_MULTIPLIER_LIMIT` on initialization

## Summary
In `MlumStaking::initialize()` the `_maxLockMultiplier` is set to `20000` ( 200% ), while the limit for this variable is supposed to be `MAX_LOCK_MULTIPLIER_LIMIT`.
## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/42e799446595c542eff9519353d3becc50cdba63/magicsea-staking/src/MlumStaking.sol#L109
## Impact
Until `setLockMultiplierSettings()` is called to adjust `_maxLockMultipler`, it is possible to create a staking position for `_maxLockDuration` ( 365 days ) and get a multiplier that is higher than the expected limit. 

## Proof of Code
- mlumStaking is initialized
- user creates a position with max duration getting an unfairly large multiplier
- the owner of the contract realizes the mistake and calls `setLockMultiplierSettings()` with the right value
- any user will get a worse deal than the first user ( or users ) 

A test file that is deploying locally all the required contracts from the codebase was created to provide proof of codes for MagicSea audit. In the ./magicsea-staking/test directory create a PoC.t.sol test file and paste into it the code from this [gist](https://gist.github.com/bbl4de/fbc6bba016f3bd876a12d0b06b7d78b8). For the code to compile the name of the ERC20Mock contract in ./src/mocks/ERC20Mock.sol needs to be changed to `ERC20MockWithRoles`. Then, run:
```shell
forge test --mt test_max_lock_multiplier_exceeds_limit -vv
```
As expected a position with a multiplier `20000` was created. 

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    uint256 public constant MAX_LOCK_MULTIPLIER_LIMIT = 15000; // 150%, high limit for maxLockMultiplier (100 = 1%)
```
```solidity
 function initialize(address initialOwner) external reinitializer(2) {
        __Ownable_init(initialOwner);
        __ERC721_init("Lock staking position NFT", "lsNFT");

        _maxGlobalMultiplier = 20000;
        _maxLockDuration = 365 days;
        _maxLockMultiplier = 20000;
    }
```
## Tool used
Manual Review, Foundry

## Recommendation
Initialize the `_maxLockMultiplier` to a value limited by the `MAX_LOCK_MULTIPLIER_LIMIT`. For example `15000`:
```diff
 function initialize(address initialOwner) external reinitializer(2) {
        __Ownable_init(initialOwner);
        __ERC721_init("Lock staking position NFT", "lsNFT");

        _maxGlobalMultiplier = 20000;
        _maxLockDuration = 365 days;
-       _maxLockMultiplier = 20000;
+      _maxLockMultiplier = 15000;
    }
```
