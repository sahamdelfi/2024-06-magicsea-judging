# "deposit" function does not work therefore vote wont work in a proper implementation.

## Summary
"deposit" function in bribe rewarder does not work for anyone that will be voting, causing the voter to revert when someone calls it.
## Vulnerability Detail
The issue with this is that the **bribeRewarder** contract is not properly getting the original account when the call is coming from an external contract and that when _modify is called from deposit it has the restriction of the caller being the voter meaning checks with the **tokenId** and **message.sender** will fail as we  can presume the Voter contract isn't calling the function with their own staked positions.

## Impact
People can't vote.
## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/Voter.sol#L211
voter calls **_notifyBribes**.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/Voter.sol#L221-L225
**_notifyBribes** calls the deposit function for each **bribeRewarder**.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/rewarders/BribeRewarder.sol#L143-L144
deposit contains a modifier onlyVoter.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/rewarders/BribeRewarder.sol#L71-L72
**onlyVoter** calls **_checkVoter**.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/rewarders/BribeRewarder.sol#L393-L395
**_checkVoter** requires the the person who called the function is the **voter**/**_caller** contract so therefore to proceed the user must be the voter contract.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/rewarders/BribeRewarder.sol#L260-L264
then the deposit calls the internal _modify function this requires the user is the owner of the **tokenId** with the **ownerOf** function.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/Voter.sol#L402-L403
the **ownerOf** function calls the erc721 contract in the **mlumStaking** contract the **ownerOf** function only allows the owner of the **tokenId** and that can only be one person.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
passing through approved and owner from erc721 in **mlumstaking** function and allowing the voter approval to all tokenId's this could also present other security issues or alternatively tx.origin in the bribeRewarder.
