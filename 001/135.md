# Bribes are permanently stuck in BribeRewarder if there's no voters

## Summary

If there's no voters for any of the bribed periods, bribes for that period will be stuck in BribeRewarder, as there's no function to withdraw provided bribes from BribeRewarder.

## Vulnerability Detail

Bribes flow is the following:

1. BribeRewarder is deployed via RewarderFactory for specific (token, pool);
2. BR owner creates a bribe via `bribe` or `fundAndBribe`, specifying which periods to bribe and `amountPerPeriod`;
3. After the first of these periods starts, each vote for that pool triggers internal `_notifyBribes`, which calls BR's `deposit`;
4. Once a period is over, each voter can `claim` their bribes for that period.

But if there wasn't any voters during a voting period, nobody will be able to withdraw funds allocated for that period from BribeRewarder, therefore they will be stuck in the contract.

## Impact

Stuck funds in BribeRewarder if it had zero voters during any of its voting periods.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Introduce a function that would allow the owner to withdraw funds from their BribeRewarder if there was not any voters.
