# Lack of Upper Limit Check for _maxLockDuration in setLockMultiplierSettings

## Summary
The setLockMultiplierSettings function allows the owner or operator to set the maximum lock duration and multiplier for locking. However, the function lacks an upper limit check for _maxLockDuration, potentially leading to excessively long lock durations.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function includes checks for maxLockMultiplier but not for _maxLockDuration. This could allow setting excessively high lock durations, affecting the locking mechanism and bonus multipliers.

## Impact
Setting an excessively high _maxLockDuration can disrupt the intended lock mechanism, leading to user dissatisfaction and potential misuse. The bonus multipliers associated with lock durations might become disproportionately high, affecting the economic incentives and rewards distribution within the system.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add an upper limit check for _maxLockDuration to ensure it remains within a reasonable range.

`require(maxLockDuration <= 365 days, "too long"); // Add upper limit check for maxLockDuration
`
