# Incorrect Lock Duration and Multiplier Calculation for Fee-On-Transfer Tokens in MlumStaking Contract

## Summary
A medium-severity vulnerability has been identified in the `MlumStaking` contract within the `addToPosition` function. The issue involves incorrect calculation of the new lock duration when dealing with fee-on-transfer tokens, leading to inconsistent duration and multiplier calculations.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `addToPosition` function calculates the new lock duration using the input token amount before considering the transfer fee. For fee-on-transfer tokens, this results in a mismatch between the expected and actual transferred amounts, causing incorrect duration. The lock multiplier is then incorrectly calculated based on the pre-fee amount, leading to inaccurate staking benefits.

## Impact
Users may receive incorrect staking benefits due to the inconsistent calculation of lock duration and lock multiplier. This can lead to a reduction in their voting power and overall staking rewards, particularly when fee-on-transfer tokens are involved.

```solidity
function addToPosition(uint256 tokenId, uint256 amountToAdd) external override nonReentrant {
    _requireOnlyOperatorOrOwnerOf(tokenId);
    require(amountToAdd > 0, "0 amount"); // addToPosition: amount cannot be null

    _updatePool();
    address nftOwner = ERC721Upgradeable.ownerOf(tokenId);
    _harvestPosition(tokenId, nftOwner); // removes rewards

    StakingPosition storage position = _stakingPositions[tokenId];

    // calculate the avg lock time:
    uint256 remainingLockTime = _remainingLockTime(position);
    uint256 avgDuration = (remainingLockTime * position.amount + amountToAdd * position.initialLockDuration)
        / (position.amount + amountToAdd);

    position.startLockTime = _currentBlockTimestamp();
    position.lockDuration = avgDuration;

    // update lock multiplier based on new avg duration
    position.lockMultiplier = getMultiplierByLockDuration(position.initialLockDuration); // needs to change in regard of the new duration, not the old one

    // handle tokens with transfer tax
    amountToAdd = _transferSupportingFeeOnTransfer(stakedToken, msg.sender, amountToAdd);   

    // update position
    position.amount = position.amount + amountToAdd;
    _stakedSupply = _stakedSupply + amountToAdd;
    _updateBoostMultiplierInfoAndRewardDebt(position);

    emit AddToPosition(tokenId, msg.sender, amountToAdd);
}
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
To ensure consistent calculations, the `amountToAdd` should be adjusted for transfer fees before calculating the average lock duration and lock multiplier. This will ensure that the actual transferred amount is used throughout the calculations, providing accurate staking benefits.
```solidity
function addToPosition(uint256 tokenId, uint256 amountToAdd) external override nonReentrant {
    _requireOnlyOperatorOrOwnerOf(tokenId);
    require(amountToAdd > 0, "0 amount"); // addToPosition: amount cannot be null

    _updatePool();
    address nftOwner = ERC721Upgradeable.ownerOf(tokenId);
    _harvestPosition(tokenId, nftOwner); // removes rewards

    StakingPosition storage position = _stakingPositions[tokenId];

    // handle tokens with transfer tax
    amountToAdd = _transferSupportingFeeOnTransfer(stakedToken, msg.sender, amountToAdd); //@audit - move the amountToAdd here

    // calculate the avg lock time:
    uint256 remainingLockTime = _remainingLockTime(position);
    uint256 avgDuration = (remainingLockTime * position.amount + amountToAdd * position.initialLockDuration)
        / (position.amount + amountToAdd);

    position.startLockTime = _currentBlockTimestamp();
    position.lockDuration = avgDuration;

    position.lockMultiplier = getMultiplierByLockDuration(position.initialLockDuration); 

    // update position
    position.amount = position.amount + amountToAdd;
    _stakedSupply = _stakedSupply + amountToAdd;
    _updateBoostMultiplierInfoAndRewardDebt(position);

    emit AddToPosition(tokenId, msg.sender, amountToAdd);
}
```
