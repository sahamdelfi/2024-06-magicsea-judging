# ‌Bribe givers cannot sweep their residual assets

## Summary
‌[Bribe givers deposit assets into BribeRewarder](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/rewarders/BribeRewarder.sol#L111) to make some pools attractive for voters but in some cases its possible anyone don't vote to that pool hence assets of ‌bribe givers will be locked in BribeRewarder for ever and
[based on docs](https://docs.magicsea.finance/protocol/magic/magic-lum-voting)
> Bribes as an additional incentive to vote can be claimed 24-48 hours after an epoch has ended. Voters can claim the rewards until the next epoch is ended. <ins>Unclaimed rewards will be sent back to the briber</ins>

## Vulnerability Detail
any rewarder extended from BaseRewarder they have [sweep function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/rewarders/BaseRewarder.sol#L208) for repay left over assets to rewarder's owner but because BribeRewarder doesn't extend from BaseRewarder hence that hasn't any functionality for sweep residual assets 

## Impact
there is no way for repay leftover assets to bribe giver

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Its better to add sweep function to BribeRewarder
