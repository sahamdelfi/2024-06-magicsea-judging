# During emergency, funds can be withdrawn from a lock by the approved address or owner, instead of exclusively by owner

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
The following comment states that only the owner of lsNFT should be able to call `emergencyWithdraw`:
```solidity
    /**
     * Withdraw without caring about rewards, EMERGENCY ONLY
     *
     * Can only be called by lsNFT's owner
     */
    function emergencyWithdraw(uint256 tokenId) external override nonReentrant {
```

However, because `_withdrawFromPosition` [allows withdrawals of unexpired locks during emergency](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/MlumStaking.sol#L626), and because `withdrawFromPosition` can be called by the approved address, during emergency, the approved address can unlock MLUM from unexpired locks.

```solidity
    function _withdrawFromPosition(address nftOwner, uint256 tokenId, uint256 amountToWithdraw) internal {
        require(amountToWithdraw > 0, "null");
        // withdrawFromPosition: amount cannot be null


        StakingPosition storage position = _stakingPositions[tokenId];
        require(
            _unlockOperators.contains(nftOwner)
                || (position.startLockTime + position.lockDuration) <= _currentBlockTimestamp() || isUnlocked(),
            "locked"
        );
```

## Impact

Approved address can execute a withdrawal of unexpired locks during emergency.
