# MlumStaking._requireOnlyOperatorOrOwnerOf incorrect  implementation

## Summary

From the function name, we can infer that it aims to restrict access to those who are not the owner of the tokenId or do not have the operator role. However, the function fails to achieve this objective.

## Vulnerability Detail

The function internally calls:

```solidity
require(ERC721Upgradeable._isAuthorized(msg.sender, msg.sender, tokenId), "FORBIDDEN");
```

According to the OpenZeppelin implementation, this is equivalent to requiring `owner == spender`, which is always true in this case, **even when msg.sender is not the owner of the tokenId**.

OpenZeppelin implementation:

```solidity
function _isAuthorized(address owner, address spender, uint256 tokenId) internal view virtual returns (bool) {
    return
        spender != address(0) &&
        (owner == spender || isApprovedForAll(owner, spender) || _getApproved(tokenId) == spender);
}
```

## Impact

The only function that currently uses `_requireOnlyOperatorOrOwnerOf` is `addToPosition`. While it does not seem especially harmful at the moment, it likely does not achieve the intended objective.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

If the function aims to only allow calls by the operator role and the owner of the NFT (excluding approved users), it should look something like this:

```solidity
function _requireOnlyOperatorOrOwnerOf(uint256 tokenId) internal view {
    require(msg.sender == ownerOf(tokenId) || msg.sender == _operator, "FORBIDDEN");
}
```
