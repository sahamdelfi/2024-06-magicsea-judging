# Blocking voters from receiving extra bribe rewards

## Summary
Blocking voters from receiving extra bribe rewards.

## Vulnerability Detail
All bribe reward contracts register themselves in the `Voter` contract. This can be problematic because a malicious user can create several empty bribe reward contracts (by empty, I mean reward contracts with very small amounts as rewards) and block other users from creating reward contracts with larger reward amounts.

This can easily be done because only 5 reward contracts can be added to a given period and pool.

```solidity
require(_bribesPerPriod[periods[i]][pool].length + 1 <= Constants.MAX_BRIBES_PER_POOL, "too much bribes");

```

A bribe reward contract is used to reward users who vote for a given period and pool to receive a reward for their vote. This can be `DDoS` by malicious users through the creation of many empty reward contracts and registering them in the `Voter` contract. This can be done by anyone who notices that a particular pool is more likely to be voted on by users, thereby blocking for examle the next 100 periods with zero rewards given to the voters.
