# Honest bribeRewarder can be DoS while registering in Voter.sol

## Summary
Honest bribeRewarder can be DoS while registering in Voter.sol due to MAX_BRIBES_PER_POOL

## Vulnerability Detail
Only 5 bribeRewarder can be created per pool. An attacker can take advantage of that to DoS honest rewarder by creating MAX_BRIBES_PER_POOL
```solidity
    function onRegister() external override {
        IBribeRewarder rewarder = IBribeRewarder(msg.sender);

        _checkRegisterCaller(rewarder);

        uint256 currentPeriodId = _currentVotingPeriodId;
        (address pool, uint256[] memory periods) = rewarder.getBribePeriods();
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < periods.length; ++i) {
            // TODO check if rewarder token + pool  is already registered

            require(periods[i] >= currentPeriodId, "wrong period");
    @>  require(_bribesPerPriod[periods[i]][pool].length + 1 <= Constants.MAX_BRIBES_PER_POOL, "too much bribes");
            _bribesPerPriod[periods[i]][pool].push(rewarder);
        }
    }
```
Attacker will create 5 bribeRewarder for the pool that honest user wanted to create and will fund it with very less amount(eg: 1 wei) and will register in Voter.sol

Now, when honest user will register it will revert due to MAX_BRIBES_PER_POOL error.

## Impact
Honest rewarder can be DoS for as long as attacker wants
