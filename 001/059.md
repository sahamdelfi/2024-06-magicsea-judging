# Unlocked positions can still vote

## Summary

Expired lock positions can still vote, and will cause wrong distribution of rewards due to being able to vote where it shouldn't.

## Vulnerability Detail

Per the code comments, the condition to be able to vote is that a position has to have locked for a minimum of 3 months, and is locked:

```solidity
// check if _minimumLockTime >= initialLockDuration and it is locked
if (_mlumStaking.getStakingPosition(tokenId).initialLockDuration < _minimumLockTime) {
    revert IVoter__InsufficientLockTime();
}
if (_mlumStaking.getStakingPosition(tokenId).lockDuration < _periodDuration) {
    revert IVoter__InsufficientLockTime();
}
```

However there's no check that the position is actually locked. `lockDuration` is the duration of the lock since the lock's start time, and is never changed for as long as the owner never touches the position.

Thus, expired lock positions can still vote, violating a defined constraints. Wrong voting weights will cause wrong distribution of LUM rewards.

The following PoC shows that expired lock positions can still vote successfully. 

```solidity
function testVotePastDeadline() public {
    vm.prank(DEV);
    _voter.startNewVotingPeriod();

    address pool = _getDummyPools()[0];
    _createPosition(ALICE);

    vm.startPrank(ALICE);
    _voter.vote(1, _getDummyPools(), _getDeltaAmounts());
    vm.stopPrank();
    assertEq(1e18, _voter.getPoolVotesPerPeriod(_voter.getCurrentVotingPeriod(), pool));

    skip(1209600*100); // skip forward 100 weeks (2 years)
    vm.prank(DEV);
    _voter.startNewVotingPeriod();

    vm.startPrank(ALICE);
    _voter.vote(1, _getDummyPools(), _getDeltaAmounts());
    vm.stopPrank();
    assertEq(1e18, _voter.getPoolVotesPerPeriod(_voter.getCurrentVotingPeriod(), pool));
}
```

## Impact

Expired lock positions can still vote, breaking a defined voting criteria, and causing wrong distribution of rewards by inflating the weights for their voted pools.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

In `MlumStaking`, expose a public/external function that reads into `_remainingLockTime()` of a position, and use it to determine whether a position is still locked.
