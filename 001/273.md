# Anyone can prevent pools from being bribable

## Summary

A malicious actor can prevent any pool from being bribable

## Vulnerability Detail

Anyone can create a bribe rewarder from the rewarder factory with any reward token for any pool and register it. Because each pool has a maximum of 5 bribe rewarders per epoch and there're no restrictions on the reward token or pool to register to , that means that anyone(or someone with incentive to want a specific pool to be voted for or to not be voted for) can literally create a token and a bunch of  rewarders with said token to fill a pool's `bribesPerPeriod`,  disincentivizing voters from voting for that sepcific pool.

## Impact

malicious briber can disincentivize voters from voting for other pools by registering rewarders with dust reward tokens

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

There isn't any clear way to prevent someone from registering any rewarder on any pool ,however bribeRewarder reward tokens can be restricted to known/whitelisted tokens to atleast make it exponsive to do so.
