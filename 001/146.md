# The function `vote` does not check if the position is locked for the current vote period.

## Summary

The function `vote` does not check if the position is locked for the current vote period. As a result, users can withdraw their position back as soon as they vote.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the function vote, the protocol checks the `initialLockDuration` and `lockDuration` to ensure the position has a long lock time. However, it does not check if the position is locked for the current period. Therefore, users can withdraw their position back as soon as they vote. As a result, an attacker can increase the weight of a pool without being locked.

## Impact

An attacker can increase the weight of a pool without being locked.
