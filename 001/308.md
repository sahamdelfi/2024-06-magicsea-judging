# `BribeRewarder.claim()` perpetually becomes more gas-intensive as voting period passes

## Summary

`BribeRewarder.claim()` loops through all periods up to the *current* voting period instead of the bribe-end period, causing claiming to perpetually become more gas-intensive as voting period passes.

## Vulnerability Detail

A user can claim their bribe rewards through `BribeRewarder.claim()`. The function loops through all bribed voting periods and calculate rewards for each period.

However, note that the function loops through each period, from `_startVotingPeriod` all the way to the current finished period, irrespective of whether the current period is still under bribes or not.

```solidity
function claim(uint256 tokenId) external override {
    uint256 endPeriod = IVoter(_caller).getLatestFinishedPeriod();
    // ...
    for (uint256 i = _startVotingPeriod; i <= endPeriod; ++i) { 
        totalAmount += _modify(i, tokenId, 0, true);
    }
}
```

That means every time a new voting period begins, the loop increases the iteration count by one, and gas cost becomes more gas extensive due to `_modify()` performing many storage reads and writes.

For example, if the bribe rewards were meant for periods 10 to 20, but the current finished period is 100, then the loop would still go through every periods from 10 to 100, even though it should only have looped to period 20. 

## Impact

Claiming becomes more and more gas-intensive as each voting period passes.

Note that at the current state of the IOTA EVM, it cannot realistically cause an OOG DoS, as the gas limit for every block is set to 1 billion gas.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

`endPeriod` should be set to `min(IVoter(_caller).getLatestFinishedPeriod(), _lastVotingPeriod);`
