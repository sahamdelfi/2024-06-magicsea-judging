# Missing `sweep` function will left residual bribe rewards stuck in `BribeRewarder`

## Summary

Missing `sweep` function will left residual rewards stuck in `BribeRewarder`.

## Vulnerability Detail

The owner of `BribeRewarder` has to fund the rewards **in full** from the start voting period to the last voting period

But the rewards will **only** start accruing when there is a first voter in current voting period (note that the `BribeRewarder#claim` function does not update the rewards in current voting period). When there is a first voter, the `oldTotalSupply` will be zero 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/42e799446595c542eff9519353d3becc50cdba63/magicsea-staking/src/rewarders/BribeRewarder.sol#L278

Since `oldTotalSupply` is zero, the `debtPerShare` is also be zero

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/42e799446595c542eff9519353d3becc50cdba63/magicsea-staking/src/rewarders/BribeRewarder.sol#L282

meaning that the rewards are not given from the start of voting period to the time there is a first voter.

Since voting will required a `lsNFT` position, that required locking up `MLUM`, there will be a situation where a pool will receive no vote during some duration in the start of voting period. In that case, the rewards are not given out in that duration.

## Impact

Since there is a situation, where the rewards are not given out entirely, and there is no function for the owner to collect the residual rewards, so the residual rewards will be stuck in `BribeRewarder`, which will cause loss of funds for the `BribeRewarder`'s owner.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a `sweep` function that the owner can call at the end of `_lastVotingPeriod` to collect the residual reward.
