# extendLockPosition  function May Not Perform as Expected

## Summary
When a user attempts to extend their lock position , the _lockPosition function causes them to lose their waited time from previous lock.
## Vulnerability Detail
``_lockPostion`` is used to extend or renew its lock position. The issue lies in ``extendLockPosition`` this function is used to extend its lock position , ``the lock position shouldn't be expired , should be greater than the current lock duration and isUnlocked() == false``. When a user extends its position the startLockTime is set to currentBlockTimestamp it means that user time will reset 
POC:
1. alice creates a position , LockDuration = 60 days.
2. Owner locks now its possible to LockPosition.
3. a voting period has started which need 90 days to vote.
4. skip(50 days). 
5. alice calls  extendLockPosition(1 , 90 days ).
6. added time  90 - 60 days i.e 30 days .
7. then startLockTime is set to currentBlockTimestamp.``position.startLockTime = currentBlockTimestamp;``
8. so then alice time reset to 1.
9. alice needs to wait whole 90 days losing her 50 days waited time.

## Impact
lost lock time of users.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Now when extending LockDuration user's initialLockDuration is set to position  startLockTime and its  starts from its startLockTime period.
