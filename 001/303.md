# Use of uninitialized variable `lastUpdateTimestamp` leads to increased rewards inside `BaseRewarder.sol`

## Summary
`BaseRearder.sol` uses `_rewarder.lastUpdateTimestamp` in order to calculate `totalRewards` but the variable is not initialized before being used leading to much larger rewards than expected because its value is 0.

## Vulnerability Details
When the owner calls the `setRewardPerSecond` in order to setup the rewarder one of the functions called is `Rewarder::getTotalRewards` where `lastUpdateTimestamp` will be 0 because it has never been initialized before. Meaning that `timestamp - lastUpdateTimestamp` will return `block.timestamp` which will be a much larger number than the intended difference between update times.

```solidity
    function getTotalRewards(
        Parameter storage rewarder,
        uint256 rewardPerSecond,
        uint256 endTimestamp,
        uint256 totalSupply
    ) internal view returns (uint256) {
        if (totalSupply == 0) return 0;

        uint256 lastUpdateTimestamp = rewarder.lastUpdateTimestamp;  //@audit 0
        uint256 timestamp = block.timestamp > endTimestamp ? endTimestamp : block.timestamp;

        return timestamp > lastUpdateTimestamp ? (timestamp - lastUpdateTimestamp) * rewardPerSecond : 0;
    }
``` 
## Impact

Because of that `totalUnclaimedRewards` will be a number that doesn't actually represent what it should and lead with problems in `MasterChefRewarder` which inherits `BaseRewarder` with calculations further in the contract, DOS or even loss of funds when users are sent more rewards than they were supposed to until the contract runs out of reward funds.

## Recommendation
`if(lastUpdateTimestamp==0)lastUpdateTimestamp=block.timestamp;`
