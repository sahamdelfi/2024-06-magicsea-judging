# Unclaimed rewards will get stuck in the contract and can not be reclaimed by the briber

## Summary

The BribeRewarder contract in the MagicSea protocol lacks a mechanism for reclaiming unclaimed bribes, contrary to the documentation which states that unclaimed bribes should be returned to the briber after the next voting period. This results in all unclaimed rewards getting stuck in the contract and being lost, as there is no way for the briber to retrieve them.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `BribeRewarder`'s behavior if bribes are unclaimed is described as follows in the [documentation](https://docs.magicsea.finance/protocol/magic/magic-lum-voting#bribes):

```txt
Bribes as an additional incentive to vote can be claimed 24-48 hours after an epoch has ended. Voters can claim the rewards until the next epoch is ended. Unclaimed rewards will be sent back to the briber.
```

According to the documentation, the briber should be able to reclaim bribing rewards once the next voting period has passed. This is not implemented; in fact, there is no way for the briber to retrieve unclaimed rewards in the code. As a result, all unclaimed rewards will stay in the contract forever and be lost.

## Impact

This issue results in all unclaimed rewards getting stuck in the contract and not reclaimable by the briber as intended.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend allowing for a `sweep()` function, with which the briber can recoup the non-withdrawn rewards after the claiming period has passed.
