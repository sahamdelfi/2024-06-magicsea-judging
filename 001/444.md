# Wrong calculation of reward in BribeRewarder due to `_lastUpdateTimestamp`

## Summary
Wrong calculation of reward in BribeRewarder due to `_lastUpdateTimestamp`

## Vulnerability Detail
When a user `claim` his rewards in BribeRewarder, it sets `_lastUpdateTimestamp` to `block.timestamp` if block.timestamp > _lastUpdateTimestamp. This will create issue while claiming reward because this _lastUpdateTimestamp has been used while `calculating` rewards
```solidity
 if (block.timestamp > _lastUpdateTimestamp) {
            _lastUpdateTimestamp = block.timestamp;
        }
```
Suppose a user voted in 1st voting period at 6AM which sets _lastUpdateTimestamp to 6AM(block.timestamp) & again voted in 2nd voting period at 10AM(suppose voting epoch = 4hrs) which again sets _lastUpdateTimestamp to 10AM(block.timestamp)

After 4hrs(at 2PM), when user claims his reward it runs loop for 1st voting period to calculate reward based on _lastUpdateTimestamp. So endTime of 1st voting period = 10AM, timestamp will be endTime ie 10AM, timestamp is not greater than _lastUpdateTimestamp(10AM) so reward will be 0. And again _lastUpdateTimestamp will be set to 2PM in _modify()
```solidity
 function _calculateRewards(uint256 periodId) internal view returns (uint256) {
        (uint256 startTime, uint256 endTime) = IVoter(_caller).getPeriodStartEndtime(periodId);

        if (endTime == 0 || startTime > block.timestamp) {
            return 0;
        }

        uint256 duration = endTime - startTime;
        uint256 emissionsPerSecond = _amountPerPeriod / duration;

        uint256 lastUpdateTimestamp = _lastUpdateTimestamp;
        uint256 timestamp = block.timestamp > endTime ? endTime : block.timestamp;
        return timestamp > lastUpdateTimestamp ? (timestamp - lastUpdateTimestamp) * emissionsPerSecond : 0;
    }
```
Above we saw, voter lost his reward due to wrong updation of _lastUpdateTimestamp & will again loss his reward for 2nd voting period because now _lastUpdateTimestamp= 2PM which is not greater than endTime of 2nd voting period

This issue is happening due to using same _modify() for voting and claiming rewards

## Impact
User will receive less or no reward due to wrong calculation

## Tool used
VS code

## Recommendation
Don't update _lastUpdateTimestamp while deposit() or separate the functionalities of deposit() and claim
