# Expired positions remain valid without change to multipliers

## Summary

The current implementation allows positions with expired locks to maintain their boosted power and remain eligible for rewards. These positions do not have their amountWithMultiplier reset, enabling users to claim rewards based on their expired boosted positions.

## Vulnerability Detail
The current implementation allows positions with expired locks to maintain their boosted amount for claiming, while they can withdraw anytime, as `lockDuration` remains unchanged until the position holder modifies it. This is because their `position.amountWithMultiplier` variable is never reset. When the user calls `harvest()` or `harvestTo()` on his expired position, he is still allowed to claim rewards based on his full `amountWithMultiplier`.

```solidity
function _harvestPosition(uint256 tokenId, address to) internal {
    StakingPosition storage position = _stakingPositions[tokenId];

    // compute position's pending rewards
    uint256 pending = position.amountWithMultiplier * _accRewardsPerShare / PRECISION_FACTOR - position.rewardDebt;

    // transfer rewards
    if (pending > 0) {
        // send rewards
        _safeRewardTransfer(to, pending);
    }
    emit HarvestPosition(tokenId, to, pending);
}
```

## Impact
Users with expired locks are able to claim rewards based on their already expired boosted positions.

## Recommendation
2 possible methods:

1. Implement Curve's `kick()` system which allows expired (zeroed) `veCRV` users to be kicked from rewards. Ref: https://github.com/curvefi/curve-dao-contracts/blob/master/contracts/gauges/LiquidityGaugeV5.vy#L430-L446

2. Reset the users `amountWithMultiplier` to `amount` in case their lock has expired.
