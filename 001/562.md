# Incorrect `msg.sender` expected

## Summary
In Solidity, when a function in one contract calls a function on another contract, the `msg.sender` in the second function call refers to the address of the contract that made the call, not the original external caller. More can be read [here](https://dev.to/fassko/understanding-txorigin-and-msgsender-in-solidity-l9o). 
There are several instances in the protocol where the wrong address is expected to be `msg.sender`. The reasons is that it makes the incorrect assumption that `msg.sender` stays the same but in fact it changes to the contract that made the function call.

## Vulnerability Detail
Here are the instances where an issues occurs with explanation:
1. `Voter.sol` and `BribeRewarder.sol` are coded so that they interact with each other. When a user votes using `Voter.sol: vote()` the following subsequent calls to functions happen: 
`Voter.sol: vote()` -> `Voter.sol: _notifyBribes()` -> `BribeRewarder.sol: deposit()` -> `BribeRewarder.sol: _modify()`
Let's look at a part of the code for `_modify()`:
```solidity
    if (!IVoter(_caller).ownerOf(tokenId, msg.sender)) {
            revert BribeRewarder__NotOwner();
    }
```
It calls `Voter.sol:ownerOf()` to check if `msg.sender` is the owner of the `tokenId`. Here the wrong assumption is made that `msg.sender` still refers to the EOA that called `vote()`. That is not the case as `msg.sender` is now the `Voter.sol` contract itself.

2. `Voter.sol: createFarms()` is a function that can be called only by the owner. It calls `MasterchefV2.sol: add()`:
```solidity
function add(IERC20 token, IMasterChefRewarder extraRewarder) external override {
      if (msg.sender != address(_lbHooksManager)) _checkOwnerOrOperator();
      ...
}
```
Here we check that `msg.sender` is either `_lbHooksManager`, owner or operator. `_lbHooksManager` address will not be set to `Voter.sol` and we can see that from the constructor: 
```solidity
   _voter = voter;
   _rewarderFactory = rewarderFactory;
   _lbHooksManager = lbHooksManager;
```
Owner and operator on the other hand are both EOAs. The same issue that occurs in 1 happens here. `Msg.sender` is expected to be either owner, operator or hooks manager but instead it will be the address of the `Voter.sol` contract.

3. `BaseRewarder.sol` expects a `_caller` to be set in the constructor:
```solidity
     // @param caller The address of the contract that will call the onModify function.
    constructor(address caller) {
        _caller = caller;
```
`MasterChefRewarder.sol` inherits from `BaseRewarder.sol` and sets this caller during its own deployment:
```solidity
    //@param caller The address of the contract that will call the onModify function.
    constructor(address caller) BaseRewarder(caller) {}
```
As we can see from the comments this `caller` contract is expected to call `MasterChefRewarder.sol: onModify()`. Let's see what happens if it does:
```solidity
function onModify(address account, uint256 pid, uint256 oldBalance, uint256 newBalance, uint256 oldTotalSupply){
       ...
       reward = BaseRewarder.onModify(account, pid, oldBalance, newBalance, oldTotalSupply);
}
```
We can see that `MasterChefRewarder.sol: onModify()` calls `BaseRewarder.sol: onModify()`:
```solidity
    //@dev Called by the caller contract to update the rewards for a given account.
    function onModify(address account, uint256 pid, uint256 oldBalance, uint256 newBalance, uint256 oldTotalSupply) 
        public virtual override returns (uint256) { 
        if (msg.sender != _caller) revert BaseRewarder__InvalidCaller();
        }
```
As you can see it expects that `msg.sender` is the `caller` contract that called `MasterChefRewarder.sol: onModify()`. However that is not the case as the `msg.sender` is now the `MasterChefRewarder.sol` contract itself.

## Impact
In all instances of this bug the transaction will simply revert. Because of this a lot of the functionality of the protocol will not work.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
For 1: `BribeRewarder.sol: _modify()` is called on deposits and claims. Deposits happen when users call `Voter.sol: vote()`. The `vote()` function already checks if caller is the owner of the `tokenId`. However `claim()` does not. The simplest fix is to remove the check for the owner of the `tokenId` in `_modify()` and instead put it in `claim()`:
```diff
    function _modify(uint256 periodId, uint256 tokenId, int256 deltaAmount, bool isPayOutReward) private
        returns (uint256 rewardAmount) {
-       if (!IVoter(_caller).ownerOf(tokenId, msg.sender)) {
-           revert BribeRewarder__NotOwner();
-        }
         ...
```
```diff
    function claim(uint256 tokenId) external override {
+       if (!IVoter(_caller).ownerOf(tokenId, msg.sender)) {
+           revert BribeRewarder__NotOwner();
+        }
...    
```

For 2: Expect the caller of `MasterchefV2.sol: add()` to be the voter contract: 
```diff
function add(IERC20 token, IMasterChefRewarder extraRewarder) external override {
-      if (msg.sender != address(_lbHooksManager)) _checkOwnerOrOperator();
+      if (msg.sender != address(_lbHooksManager) || msg.sender != address(_voter)) _checkOwnerOrOperator();
      ...
}
```

For 3:
Perhaps you can change the constructor of `MasterChefRewarder.sol` like so:
```diff
-   constructor(address caller) BaseRewarder(caller) {}
+   constructor() BaseRewarder(address(this)) {}
```
