# Users retain their voting power even when their lock expires

## Summary

`lockDuration` check in the `Voter` contract is not sufficient and will enable users with expired locks to retain their voting power forever.

## Vulnerability Detail

As mentioned in `MagicSea` [[docs](https://docs.magicsea.finance/protocol/magic/magic-lum-voting)](https://docs.magicsea.finance/protocol/magic/magic-lum-voting):

> The overall lock needs to be longer than 90 days and the remaining lock period needs to be longer than the epoch time.
> 

The `lockDuration` should be at least longer than the current period duration, but the issue is that if users only harvest their positions without modifying them they will be able to vote forever, since it only check for the overall duration, not the remaining lock time of a position:

```solidity
function vote(uint256 tokenId, address[] calldata pools, uint256[] calldata deltaAmounts) external {
...MORE CODE
    // check if _minimumLockTime >= initialLockDuration and it is locked
    if (_mlumStaking.getStakingPosition(tokenId).initialLockDuration < _minimumLockTime) {
        revert IVoter__InsufficientLockTime();
    }
    if (_mlumStaking.getStakingPosition(tokenId).lockDuration < _periodDuration) {
        revert IVoter__InsufficientLockTime();
    }
}
```

The valid requirement is the `initialLockDuration` to be longer than 90 days, the second check doesnâ€™t properly check how much time there is until the position is unlocked. As we mentioned this makes each position with `lockDuration` > 90 days, to be able to vote forever.

## Impact

Users with expired positions will be able to vote.

## Recommendation

Modify the check to validate the remaining lock duration, instead of the overall lock duration:

```solidity
if ((_mlumStaking.getStakingPosition(tokenId).startLockTime + _mlumStaking.getStakingPosition(tokenId).lockDuration) - block.timestamp < _periodDuration) {
        revert IVoter__InsufficientLockTime();
    }
```
