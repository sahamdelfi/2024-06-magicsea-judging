# Denial of Service attack for bribe mechanism

## Summary

The process of providing bribes for voting in a pool involves creating a `BribeRewarder` using `RewardFactory`, funding it, and registering it through the `Voter` contract's [`onRegister`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/Voter.sol#L130-L144) function. However, a [limit of 5 rewarders per pool](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/Voter.sol#L141) creates a vulnerability where attackers could saturate a pool with ineffective `BribeRewarders` and preventing legitimate participation.

## Vulnerability Detail

To provide bribes for voting in a pool, one must use `RewardFactory` to create a `BribeRewarder`. After creation, the owner can fund it and execute the bribe logic, registering the `BribeRewarder` as a rewarder for the pool in the `Voter` contract through the [`onRegister`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/Voter.sol#L130-L144) function. However, a limitation allows a [maximum of 5 `BribeRewarders` per pool](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/Voter.sol#L141). This could enable an attacker to create 5 `BribeRewarders` without valuable bribes and register them for a targeted pool. This action prevents legitimate `BribeRewarders` from registering as a rewarder for the pool, discouraging users from voting for it.

## Impact

The attacker can prevent legitimate bribe rewarders from offering bribes for the given pool, effectively discouraging users from voting for it.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to redesign the logic in a way it will be not possible to prevent legitimate bribers from participating.
