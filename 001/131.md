# `createPosition()` and `addToPosition()` are callable even in case of emergency, decreasing rewards for users

## Summary
Any user can create MLUM staking position with `createPosition()` during emergency and add more funds to it with `addToPosition()`, assuming the `lockDuration` is set to 0 - and therefore the multiplier is 0.
## Vulnerability Detail
Creation of new positions should not be allowed during an emergency according to the following comment in `createPosition()` function:
```solidity
// no new lock can be set if the pool has been unlocked
        if (isUnlocked()) {
            require(lockDuration == 0, "locks disabled");
        }
```
Unfortunately, the check in the code snippet above still allows locks with duration set to 0. This kind of call will not fail, as according to the sponsor, creation of locks with `lockDuration == 0` is an intended functionality - it simply creates a staking position with no multiplier as in `getMultiplierByLockDuration()`:
```solidity
if (_maxLockDuration == 0 || lockDuration == 0) return 0;
```
However, in case of an emergency *ANY* call to `createPosition()` **AND** `addToPosition()` must be reverted.
## Impact
Creating a position during emergency would decrease the rewards that other users are eligible for.  As the users are allowed to choose to withdraw their funds during emergency with `withdrawFromPosition()`, rather than `emergencyWithdraw()`. Any user withdrawing their funds without the rewards - through `emergencyWithdraw()` would incentivize the malicious user to call `addToPosition()` and increase their stake to gain more rewards when they finally withdraw they stake. Note that the malicious user can withdraw their funds at any time, because their `lockDuration` was set to 0. 

## Proof of Code
A test file that is deploying locally all the required contracts from the codebase was created to provide proof of codes for MagicSea audit. In the ./magicsea-staking/test directory create a PoC.t.sol test file and paste into it the code from this [gist](https://gist.github.com/bbl4de/fbc6bba016f3bd876a12d0b06b7d78b8). For the code to compile the name of the ERC20Mock contract in ./src/mocks/ERC20Mock.sol needs to be changed to ERC20MockWithRoles. Then, run:
```shell
forge test --mt test_createPosition_and_addToPosition_callable_during_emergency
```
For simplicity of the test the rewards where not included, but it is verified that the position is created successfully and `_stakedSupplyWithMultiplier` is increased. We can see in `_updatePool()` function ( called before any reward harvesting ) that `_accRewardsPerShare` is updated based on `_stakedSupplyWithMultiplier` :
```solidity
_accRewardsPerShare =
            accRewardsPerShare +
            ((accruedReward * (PRECISION_FACTOR)) /
                (_stakedSupplyWithMultiplier));
```
Therefore, rewards distribution would be indeed affected.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The essential part of the mitigation is locking the `createPosition()` and `addToPosition()` functions completely if the contract is in emergency by adding the following check:
```solidity
require(!isUnlocked(), "locks disabled");
```
similarily to the `_lockPosition()` function where it's implemented correctly.

Although it does not present an attack vector in itself, allowing staking positions with `lockDuration` set to 0 should be reconsidered due to its questionable fairness and lack of risk for stakers who choose this option ( no lock on their funds ).
