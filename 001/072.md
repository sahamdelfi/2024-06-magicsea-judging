# The `vote()` function in the `Voter` contract is vulnerable to a logic flaw that prevents it from functioning correctly when a `BribeRewarder` contract is involved.

## Summary
The `vote()` function in the `Voter` contract is vulnerable to a logic flaw that prevents it from functioning correctly when a `BribeRewarder` contract is involved.

## Vulnerability Detail
The issue lies in the _`modify()` function of the `BribeRewarder` contract, which is called during the `vote()` process. Specifically, the `_modify()` function checks if `msg.sender` is the owner of the `tokenId` being voted with. However, when `_modify()` is called from the `deposit()` function (which is triggered by `_notifyBribes()` during `vote()`), `msg.sender` is the `Voter` contract itself, not the actual user voting.

This means that the ownership check in `_modify()` will always fail, as the Voter contract is not the owner of the `tokenId`. Consequently, the `vote()` function will always revert when a `BribeRewarder` contract is involved, effectively breaking the core voting functionality.

## Impact
The inability to successfully execute the `vote()` function when a `BribeRewarder` contract is present is a critical issue, as it prevents users from participating in the voting process, which is a core functionality of the protocol.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
To resolve this issue, the ownership check in the `_modify()` function should be modified to use `tx.origin` instead of `msg.sender`. This will ensure that the check is performed against the original user who initiated the transaction, rather than the `Voter` contract.

However, it's important to note that using tx.origin introduces a potential security risk, as it can enable phishing attacks if users interact with malicious contracts. Therefore, it's recommended to carefully consider the trade-offs and potential risks before implementing this change.

Alternatively, a more comprehensive solution could involve refactoring the `_modify()` function to handle the case where `msg.sender` is the Voter contract, and perform the ownership check against the original user who initiated the `vote()` transaction.
