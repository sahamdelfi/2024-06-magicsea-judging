Manual Review

## Recommendation
We have to add a function to sweep remained funds in `BribeRewarder.sol` as follows.
```solidity
    function sweep(IERC20 token, address account) public virtual override onlyOwner {
        (, uint256 endTime) = IVoter(_caller).getPeriodStartEndtime(_lastVotingPeriod);

        require(endTime <= block.timestamp, "Not ended");

        uint256 balance = _balanceOfThis(token);
        if (balance == 0) revert BaseRewarder__ZeroAmount();

        _safeTransferTo(token, account, balance);

        emit Swept(token, account, balance);
    }
```
