# BribeRewarder.sol#deposit() will revert because of wrong check

## Summary
`deposit` calls `_modify` but it will revert because the `msg.sender` will be the voter contract which will make the `onlyOwner` check revert
 
## Vulnerability Detail
`deposit` function has `onlyVoter` that checks if the `msg.sender` is the voter contract, so when a user votes, `deposit` function is called from the voter contract.

The problem is `deposit` calls `_modify` and there is a check that ensure the `msg.sender` is the tokenId owner. However, the `msg.sender` in this situation will be the voter contract and this will make the transaction revert.
```js
       if (!IVoter(_caller).ownerOf(tokenId, msg.sender)) {
            revert BribeRewarder__NotOwner();
        }
```
## Impact
It is impossible to vote for pools that have bribe rewarders.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The `onlyOwner` check is used when users are claiming their rewards, so remove it from the `_modify` and add it to the `claim`.
