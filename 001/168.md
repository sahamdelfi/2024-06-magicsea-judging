# Rounding down `avgDuration` in `MlumStaking#addToPosition` allows users add `MLUM` to a position without extending `lockDuration` at the end of a locking period

## Summary

Rounding down `avgDuration` in `MlumStaking#addToPosition` allows users add `MLUM` to a position without extending `lockDuration` at the end of a locking period.

## Vulnerability Detail

When a user calls `MlumStaking#addToPosition`, the new `lockDuration` is calculated at 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/42e799446595c542eff9519353d3becc50cdba63/magicsea-staking/src/MlumStaking.sol#L410-L411

At the end of a locking period `remainingLockTime` will be zero. From the calculation, `avgDuration` will be rounded to zero when

```bash
(amountToAdd * position.initialLockDuration) / (position.amount + amountToAdd) < 1
=> amountToAdd < position.amount / (position.initialLockDuration - 1)
```

As a result, users can add `MLUM` to a position without extending `lockDuration` by setting `amountToAdd` satisfied the inequality above. 

## Impact

When adding to a position at the end of a locking period, users can avoid extending `lockDuration` by adding `100 / (position.initialLockDuration - 1) %` of the current position. 

Since the `lockMultiplier` is calculated by the `initialLockDuration`

exploiting this will increase position's `amountWithMultiplier` without extending the `lockDuration`. The position's `amountWithMultiplier` will be used as voting power in the `Voter`.
