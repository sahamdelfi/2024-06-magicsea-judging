# User may receive lesser or no rewards due to rounding error

## Summary

Users are exposed to precision loss which is caused by division before multiplication potentially leading to underestimation or complete loss of rewards

## Vulnerability Detail

In the _calculateRewards function, the emissionsPerSecond is computed as:  uint256 emissionsPerSecond = _amountPerPeriod / duration; and of whose value is then used in [L312](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/42e799446595c542eff9519353d3becc50cdba63/magicsea-staking/src/rewarders/BribeRewarder.sol#L312)

The problem here lies in the fact that, the division in emissionsPerSecond happened just before the multiplication in [L312](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/42e799446595c542eff9519353d3becc50cdba63/magicsea-staking/src/rewarders/BribeRewarder.sol#L312), which  could lead to precision loss due to division before multiplication vulnerability


This in turn would have a drastic effect in other part of the contract where the _calculateRewards function is used directly such as getPendingReward and _modify functions respectively. 

At the end, users trying to claim rewards might end up getting lesser rewards than they anticipated or nothing

## Impact

Users may receive fewer rewards than they should or potentially no rewards at all due to precision loss

## Recommendation

Fix the _calculation function to ensure multiplication is done before division

    function _calculateRewards(uint256 periodId) internal view returns (uint256) {
        (uint256 startTime, uint256 endTime) = IVoter(_caller).getPeriodStartEndtime(periodId);

        if (endTime == 0 || startTime > block.timestamp) {
            return 0;
        }

        uint256 duration = endTime - startTime;
     - uint256 emissionsPerSecond = _amountPerPeriod / duration;

        uint256 lastUpdateTimestamp = _lastUpdateTimestamp;
        uint256 timestamp = block.timestamp > endTime ? endTime : block.timestamp;
     - return timestamp > lastUpdateTimestamp ? (timestamp - lastUpdateTimestamp) * emissionsPerSecond : 0;

       +   if (timestamp <= lastUpdateTimestamp) {
       +       return 0;
       +   }
       +   return (_amountPerPeriod * (timestamp - lastUpdateTimestamp)) / duration;

    }
