# MasterChefRewarders cannot be created using the RewarderFactory

## Summary
`RewarderFactory.sol: createRewarder()` can be used to create and initialize different types of rewarders. The issue is that it cannot be used to create masterchef rewarders. 

## Vulnerability Detail
`RewarderFactory.sol: createRewarder()` calls `_clone()`:
```solidity
    function _clone(RewarderType rewarderType, IERC20 token, uint256 pid) private returns (IBaseRewarder rewarder) {
        if (rewarderType == RewarderType.InvalidRewarder) revert RewarderFactory__InvalidRewarderType();

        IRewarder implementation = _implementations[rewarderType];

        if (address(implementation) == address(0)) revert RewarderFactory__ZeroAddress();

        IRewarder[] storage rewarders = _rewarders[rewarderType];

        bytes memory immutableData = abi.encodePacked(token, pid);
        bytes32 salt = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, _nonces[msg.sender]++));

        rewarder = IBaseRewarder(ImmutableClone.cloneDeterministic(address(implementation), immutableData, salt));

        rewarders.push(rewarder);
        _rewarderTypes[rewarder] = rewarderType;

        rewarder.initialize(msg.sender);
    }
```
This function clones the implementation that is specifically set for each rewarder type and then calls `initialize()` on it. The implementation that will be set for masterchef rewarders is `MasterChefRewarder.sol`. 
The problem is that this contract does not have an `initialize()` function. If we try to create a masterchef rewarder using this factory it will revert because it will try to call a function that is not implemented on the implementation contract.

## Impact
Even though masterchef rewarders can be deployed in a different way it is imporant that they are created using the factory specifically. That is because masterchef rewarders are used as extra rewarders in `MasterChefV2.sol`. They can be added by the owner but there is a check that does not allow extra rewarders that were not created by the factory to be added:
```solidity
    function _setExtraRewarder(uint256 pid, IMasterChefRewarder extraRewarder) private {
        if (
            address(extraRewarder) != address(0)
                && _rewarderFactory.getRewarderType(extraRewarder) != IRewarderFactory.RewarderType.MasterChefRewarder
        ) {
            revert MasterChef__NotMasterchefRewarder();
        }
```

As you can see this function calls `getRewarderType()` on the rewarder factory. `getRewarderType()` returns the value of a mapping that maps each implementation clone to its rewarder type. If a masterchef rewarder is not created using the factory it will not be added to this mapping and will make this if statement revert.

Because we cannot create masterchef rewarders using the factory we also cannot add them as extra rewarders in `MasterChefV2.sol`

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Fix the implementation of `MasterChefRewarder.sol` so that it has an `initialize()` function.
