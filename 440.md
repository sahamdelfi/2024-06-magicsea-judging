# Missing Check for Existing Rewarder in `_cloneBribe` Function `RewarderFactory` contract

## Summary
The `_cloneBribe` function in the `RewarderFactory` contract does not check if a rewarder already exists before cloning a new one. This omission may allow duplicate rewarders to be created for the same pool, leading to unexpected behavior or unnecessary resource consumption.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `_cloneBribe` function clones a new bribe rewarder without first verifying if a rewarder for the specified pool already exists. This could result in multiple rewarders being associated with the same pool, potentially causing confusion in reward distribution or governance processes.
## Impact
Duplicate rewarders for the same pool could lead to inconsistent reward calculations or conflicts in governance decisions regarding rewarder management. Additionally, unnecessary gas consumption and contract state bloat could occur if rewarders are inadvertently duplicated.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a check at the beginning of the `_cloneBribe` function to verify if a rewarder already exists for the specified pool before proceeding with cloning 
```solidity 
function _cloneBribe(RewarderType rewarderType, IERC20 token, address pool)
    private
    returns (IBribeRewarder rewarder)
{
    if (rewarderType != RewarderType.BribeRewarder) revert RewarderFactory__InvalidRewarderType();

    IRewarder[] storage rewarders = _rewarders[rewarderType];

    // Check if a rewarder already exists for the specified pool
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < rewarders.length; i++) {
        if (IBribeRewarder(rewarders[i]).pool() == pool) {
            revert RewarderFactory__RewarderAlreadyExists();
        }
    }

    IRewarder implementation = _implementations[rewarderType];

    if (address(implementation) == address(0)) revert RewarderFactory__ZeroAddress();

    bytes memory immutableData = abi.encodePacked(token, pool);
    bytes32 salt = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, _nonces[msg.sender]++));

    rewarder = IBribeRewarder(ImmutableClone.cloneDeterministic(address(implementation), immutableData, salt));

    rewarders.push(rewarder);
    _rewarderTypes[rewarder] = rewarderType;

    rewarder.initialize(msg.sender);
}
```
