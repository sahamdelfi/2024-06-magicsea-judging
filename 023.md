# Less Support for Non standard ERC20 tokens such as rebase or FOT

## Summary
Some non standard ERC20 tokens such as stETH/aAAVE have a special feature of rebasing ,which results in changing of their balance during time to time.

## Vulnerability Detail
`MagicSea` is expected to support all kinds of ERC20 tokens, if one such tokens is rebasing/FOT[balances changes outside of transfer) tokens, user's may loose their expected funds.
Since, if the balance changed later, the returned value will be inaccurate. And the amount used before and after that specific operation might differ.

## Impact
Users might not see their exact amount deposited/withdrawn , which might lead to loss of users fund
The ultimate effect will be seen during withdrawal in which a point will be reached where the Token balance in the contract will be zero, while the internal accounting still registers that there are still amount available for users to collect

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
check the before and after balance of token deposit/withdraw/transfer by calling IERC20(token).balanceOf() to confirm the balance or use the relative shares of each user instead of specific amount if necessary,
