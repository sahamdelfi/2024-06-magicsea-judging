# MasterchefV2::claim is blocked in case the extra rewarder run out of funds

## Summary

In case the extraRewarder of farm is out of funds, the lum token rewards in `MasterchefV2` are also blocked, making users not being able to claim any rewards.

## Vulnerability Detail

Each farm in `MasterchefV2` can have its own `MasterChefRewarder` which is his extra rewarder. Once added the owner and the involved parties who want users to stake their farmâ€™s token must provide sufficient token amounts that will be enough to fulfill all the extra reward distribution. The problem is in the way that these extra rewards are being claimed - it is being done atomically with the `lum` token rewards in `MasterchefV2::_modify`:

```solidity
function _modify(uint256 pid, address account, int256 deltaAmount, bool isPayOutReward) private {
...MORE CODE
        if (address(extraRewarder) != address(0)) {
            extraRewarder.onModify(account, pid, oldBalance, newBalance, oldTotalSupply);
        }

        emit PositionModified(pid, account, deltaAmount, lumReward);
    }
```

```solidity
function onModify(address account, uint256 pid, uint256 oldBalance, uint256 newBalance, uint256 oldTotalSupply)
      public
      override(BaseRewarder, IBaseRewarder)
      returns (uint256 reward)
  {
      if (_status != Status.Linked) revert MasterChefRewarder__NotLinked();

      reward = BaseRewarder.onModify(account, pid, oldBalance, newBalance, oldTotalSupply);

      _claim(account, reward);
  }
  
   function _claim(address account, uint256 amount) internal virtual {
        IERC20 token = _token();

        _safeTransferTo(token, account, amount);

        emit Claim(account, token, amount);
    }
```

There is no check that the balance of the token in the `MasterChefRewarder` is enough to be transferred to the `account`. In case it is not enough, not only the extra rewards will be inaccessible, but also the `lum` token rewards that are the only guaranteed tokens from the `MasterchefV2` itself and should always be available to be claimed. 

## Impact

In case the extra rewarder for given pool runs out of funds, not only its rewards will be inaccessible, but also the `MasterchefV2`'s rewards, since both claiming happens in one transaction

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use approach similar to the `BribeRewarder` where extra tokens claiming happens separately and there is no chance of blocking the main flow.
