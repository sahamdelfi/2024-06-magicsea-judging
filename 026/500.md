# MasterchefV2::claim can be blocked for some users if extra rewarder with weird asset is being added

## Summary

Due to the atomic nature of reward distribution in `MasterchefV2`, the entire rewarding process for certain users can be blocked if an extra rewarder with a weird `rewardToken` is added later on.

## Vulnerability Detail

`MasterChefRewarder` can be added to any farm as an extra rewarder with any token assigned as `rewardToken`, we assume tokens used most often to be USDC/USDT, as both tokens contain blocklists.

The problem will be caused for users who expect to receive only `lum` tokens as rewards when extra rewarder with a weird token is added. 

- USDC for example will block the entire reward mechanism if the recipient is blacklisted, forcing the user to perform emergency withdrawal and lose all his reward tokens.
- Pausable tokens also pose a problem, because once paused they will block the claim process not only for a single user but rather for all the users who deposited in this farm.

```solidity
 function _modify(uint256 pid, address account, int256 deltaAmount, bool isPayOutReward) private {
      Farm storage farm = _farms[pid];
      Rewarder.Parameter storage rewarder = farm.rewarder;
      IMasterChefRewarder extraRewarder = farm.extraRewarder;

      (uint256 oldBalance, uint256 newBalance, uint256 oldTotalSupply,) = farm.amounts.update(account, deltaAmount);

      uint256 totalLumRewardForPid = _getRewardForPid(rewarder, pid, oldTotalSupply);
      uint256 lumRewardForPid = _mintLum(totalLumRewardForPid);

      uint256 lumReward = rewarder.update(account, oldBalance, newBalance, oldTotalSupply, lumRewardForPid);

      if (isPayOutReward) {
          lumReward = lumReward + unclaimedRewards[pid][account];
          unclaimedRewards[pid][account] = 0;
          if (lumReward > 0) _lum.safeTransfer(account, lumReward);
      } else {
          unclaimedRewards[pid][account] += lumReward;
      }

      if (address(extraRewarder) != address(0)) {
          extraRewarder.onModify(account, pid, oldBalance, newBalance, oldTotalSupply);//@audit extra rewarder's claim
      }

      emit PositionModified(pid, account, deltaAmount, lumReward);
  }
```

```solidity
function onModify(address account, uint256 pid, uint256 oldBalance, uint256 newBalance, uint256 oldTotalSupply)
      public
      override(BaseRewarder, IBaseRewarder)
      returns (uint256 reward)
  {
      if (_status != Status.Linked) revert MasterChefRewarder__NotLinked();

      reward = BaseRewarder.onModify(account, pid, oldBalance, newBalance, oldTotalSupply);

      _claim(account, reward);
  }
  
function _claim(address account, uint256 amount) internal virtual {
    IERC20 token = _token();

    _safeTransferTo(token, account, amount);

    emit Claim(account, token, amount);
}
```

## Impact

In case `MasterChefRewarder` with weird ERC20 token is added, users who are not compatible with it will lose their `lum` token rewards as well, also being forced to emergency withraw.

## Recommendation

Use the approach in `BribeRewarder` and `Voter` contracts, which is to separate the claim of extra incentives so users decide if they want to claim them.
