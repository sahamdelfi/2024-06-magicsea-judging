# Staker in the MasterchefV2 will lose all his rewards upon emergency withdrawal

  
 ## Summary
When a user withdraws using an `emergencyWithdraw` having not claimed his rewards, he will lose all his them.

## Vulnerability Detail
The rewards to be given to a user are calculated by subtracting the debt per share multiplied by his balance before the transaction by his reward debt but because the `emergencyWithdraw` makes the balance 0 without calling `_modify` all the rewards of the user are going to be lost and when he tries to call claim his transaction will revert with an underflow error

Its clear that this behavior is not intentional from the fact that the user could have claimed all his rewards before `emergencyWithdraw` and then called `emergencyWithdraw` and by the fact that there is an underflow error which proves that this was a mistake.
## Impact
Users who call `emergencyWithdraw` without having claimed their rewards are going to lose all of them
