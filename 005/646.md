# Wrong reward token calculation in MasterChefV2 Contract

## Summary
Before setting a new reward per second rate in `masterchefV2` the pools are not updated making it possible for pools to recieve morReviewe or less then they deserve depending on wether the rate was increased or decreased

## Vulnerability Detail
Althou the team was going to added the function to update pools before they commented it out and added the following comment so its safe to assume that its not present in the code:
```solidity
    /**
     * @dev Sets the LUM per second.
     * It will update all the farms that are in the top pool IDs.
     * @param lumPerSecond The new LUM per second.
     */
    function setLumPerSecond(uint96 lumPerSecond) external override onlyOwner {
        if (lumPerSecond > Constants.MAX_LUM_PER_SECOND) revert MasterChef__InvalidLumPerSecond();
        // _updateAll(_voter.getTopPoolIds()); // todo remove this
        _lumPerSecond = lumPerSecond;
        emit LumPerSecondSet(lumPerSecond);
    }
```
The following 2 senario illusrates the Vunrability best:
### Senario 1:
- Alice Deposit 100 tokens with a rate of 2 token per second
- After 1 day alice calculates how much rewards she has earned and she find out she got 1000 reward tokens
- Before alice withrawls the  rewards per second are cut in half
- Alice tries to withdraw but pool was not updated before reward rate change so the rewards are calculated using the new rate when they should have been calculated using the old one
- Alice looses 500 tokens and only recieves half what she excpected

### Senario 2:
- Bob Deposit 100 tokens with a rate of 2 token per second
- After 1 day Bob calculates how much rewards she has earned and she find out he got 1000 reward tokens
- Before Bob withrawls the rewards per second are doubled
- Bob tries to withdraw but the pool was not updated before reward rate change so the rewards are calculated using the new rate when they should have been calculated using the old one
- Bob recieves 2000 reward token, double what he reserves
- Now those rewards did not come from thin air but at the expense of the last users to claim their rewards who when attemp to do so will not be able to since 1000 reward tokens are missing

## Impact
Because of the issue outilned above users are going to loose rewards both when the rate decreases and when it increases for last claimers.

The degree of damage will depend on how frequently rewards are updated and the average activity on the pools in the masterchef
