# Change in Lum per second results in step wise jump of rewards

## Summary
The owner of `MasterChef` contract can revised the Lum per second rate at any time. The rewards are computed using the latest Lum per Second rate, which can lead to lose of some accrued rewards if the Lum per second rate was adjusted to lower side.
 
## Vulnerability Detail
Lum per second can be set by the owner using the `setLumPerSecond()` which should be effective from the time it was set. But, the current implementation takes the rate as effective from the time the rewards were last computed. This could lead of lose of accrued rewards incase the rate was adjusted to lower side.

The update function below computes the rewards per pool.

The update function below computes the rewards per pool.

In order to compute rewards, it calls `getTotalRewards` function passing in the `_lumPerSecond` configured by the owner.

Refer to how  `getTotalRewards`  function uses  `_lumPerSecond` to compute the rewards. The new `rewardPerSecond` is applied to time passed since the last update. This is incorrect since the new rewardPerSecond was not same for the accured period being computed.

```solidity
   uint256 lastUpdateTimestamp = rewarder.lastUpdateTimestamp;
   uint256 timestamp = block.timestamp > endTimestamp ? endTimestamp : block.timestamp;
   return timestamp > lastUpdateTimestamp ? (timestamp - lastUpdateTimestamp) * rewardPerSecond : 0;
```

Lets say, a user deposited 1000 tokens at 2024/07/01:00:00:00. At that time, the rate was 1 token per second(for simplicity).

**Rewards computed if no change was made to _lumPerSecond:**
```javascript
Today, if the rewards were computed, it would be 
  
  time passed in seconds *  rewardPerSecond 
  (2024/07/05:00:00:00 - 2024/07/01:00:00:00) * 1 
   =  5 days * 24 hours * 60 * 60 *1 
   = 432000
```

**correct calculation:** 
```javascript
 If the reward rate was modified on 4th July to 0.5, The correct calculation should be

  ((2024/07/04:00:00:00 - 2024/07/01:00:00:00) * 1) + (2024/07/05:00:00:00 - 2024/07/04:00:00:00) * 0.5 
  = 4 days *24 hours * 60 * 60 * 1 + 1 days * 24 * 60 * 60 * 0.5
  =  345600 + 43200
  =  388800
```

**Calculation based on current logic(incorrect rewards):**
 ```javascript
   (2024/07/05:00:00:00 - 2024/07/01:00:00:00) * 0.5 
   =  5 days * 24 hours * 60 * 60 * 0.5
   = 216000
```
Due to the current logic, 388800 - 216000 = 172800 will be lost incase the lum reward rate was adjusted downwards. 


## Impact
Users will loose accrued rewards.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
   function getTotalRewards(
        Parameter storage rewarder,
        uint256 rewardPerSecond,
        uint256 endTimestamp,
        uint256 totalSupply
    ) internal view returns (uint256) {
        if (totalSupply == 0) return 0;

        uint256 lastUpdateTimestamp = rewarder.lastUpdateTimestamp;
        uint256 timestamp = block.timestamp > endTimestamp ? endTimestamp : block.timestamp;

        return timestamp > lastUpdateTimestamp ? (timestamp - lastUpdateTimestamp) * rewardPerSecond : 0;
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Accrued rewards between the last time the rewards were computed and the time when the rate was updated should be computed at the time of changing the reward rate.
