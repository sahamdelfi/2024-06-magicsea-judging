# Function `setLumPerSecond` can cause loss of funds to both the protocol and the users

## Summary

Whenever the amount of `LUM` rewarded per second gets updated, before applying the new value, the accrued rewards so far wouldn't be claimed or taken into account whatsoever, leading to less/more rewards for the users.

## Vulnerability Detail

[MasterChefV2](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/MasterchefV2.sol) is a staking contract that allows users to deposit tokens in order to earn `LUM` tokens, which are distributed as liquidity mining rewards. The users' rewards get accrued over time and can be claimed by the user whenever they feel like it - therefore, it's a completely possible scenario, for a user to leave their tokens unattended in the contract. An issue occurs when [setLumPerSecond](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/MasterchefV2.sol#L352-L360
) is called, which updates the amount of `LUM` per second the user will get rewarded, as it updates the `_lumPerSecond` without considering the accrued rewards. This means that all of the rewards will be calculated with the newly set value, even though the pool/users had the rewards before the update of [_lumPerSecond](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/MasterchefV2.sol#L45)

The key function call within the internal [_updateAll](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/MasterchefV2.sol#L510-L530) is [getTotalRewards](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/libraries/Rewarder.sol#L51-L63), as it will determine the amount of rewards a user will get.

An example flow of why [updateAll](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/MasterchefV2.sol#L343-L345) has to be called within [setLumPerSecond](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/MasterchefV2.sol#L352-L360):

### The current implementation:

1. `setLumPerSecond` gets called and thereby updates `_lumPerSecond` to half the tokens (this can be any amount, both less/more tokens than before, but for the sake of simplicity, we will keep it half of the previous amount).
2. A user calls [claim](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/MasterchefV2.sol#L316-L320) in order to claim their rewards, where _modify is called as well.
3. Within _modify, a call to [_getRewardForPid](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/MasterchefV2.sol#L460-L466) is made in order to calculate `totalLumRewardForPid`, where `_lumPerSecond` is [passed as an argument](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/MasterchefV2.sol#L465) in the call to [getTotalRewards](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/libraries/Rewarder.sol#L51-L63)
4. The returned value is the total `LUM` reward, where it can be added to a mapping of [unclaimedRewards](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/MasterchefV2.sol#L552) or immediately withdrawn by the user with a [safeTransfer](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/MasterchefV2.sol#L554)
5. In both cases, the user will have their total rewards slashed in half due to the `_lumPerSecond` being updated, even though they had the rewards beforehand. This is due to the fact that there wasn't an update on the amount of rewards owed.

### The updated implementation:

```diff
    function setLumPerSecond(uint96 lumPerSecond) external override onlyOwner {
        if (lumPerSecond > Constants.MAX_LUM_PER_SECOND) revert MasterChef__InvalidLumPerSecond();

+     updateAll(_voter.getTopPoolIds());
       ...
```

1. `setLumPerSecond` gets called, and consequently [updateAll](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/MasterchefV2.sol#L343-L345) is called as well.
2. The internal [_updateAll](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/MasterchefV2.sol#L510-L530) function gets the amount of `totalRewards` via [getTotalRewards](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/libraries/Rewarder.sol#L72-L78), where `lumPerSecond` is passed as an argument.
3. After which, `totalRewards` is used to calculate the exact reward for the pool, and the `LUM` is directly minted for the protocol to give out as rewards.
4. The debt per share is [updated](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/MasterchefV2.sol#L528) (this keeps track of the rewards owed to a specific pool id).
5. Now the user can call [claim](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/MasterchefV2.sol#L316-L320) and they will get the exact amount of rewards they were owed prior to the update and any new rewards accrued after the update, but adjusted to the new `_lumPerSecond`.

## Impact

As the [_updateAll](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/MasterchefV2.sol#L343-L345) call was omitted, this can cause `loss of funds` for both the protocol and the user, depending on the case.

Bear in mind that this is not a centralization issue, as the admin can set any amount of `lumPerSecond` and the same impact would still exist.

## Recommendation

Consider implementing the following changes to [setLumPerSecond](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/MasterchefV2.sol#L352-L360):
```diff
    function setLumPerSecond(uint96 lumPerSecond) external override onlyOwner {
         if (lumPerSecond > Constants.MAX_LUM_PER_SECOND) revert MasterChef__InvalidLumPerSecond();

+        updateAll(_voter.getTopPoolIds());

         _lumPerSecond = lumPerSecond;

         emit LumPerSecondSet(lumPerSecond);
    }
```
