# `MasterchefV2.sol#setLumPerSecond` function doesn't update accrued debt for top pool IDs.

## Summary
`MasterchefV2.sol#setLumPerSecond` function doesn't update accrued debt for top pool IDs.
This causes new `_lumPerSecond` applies to the period before it was set.

## Vulnerability Detail
`MasterchefV2.sol#setLumPerSecond` function is the following.
```solidity
    function setLumPerSecond(uint96 lumPerSecond) external override onlyOwner {
        if (lumPerSecond > Constants.MAX_LUM_PER_SECOND) revert MasterChef__InvalidLumPerSecond();

355:    // _updateAll(_voter.getTopPoolIds()); // todo remove this

        _lumPerSecond = lumPerSecond;

        emit LumPerSecondSet(lumPerSecond);
    }
```
In `L355`, `_updateAll(_voter.getTopPoolIds());` is commented now.
Therefore, the new `_lumPerSecond` may applies to the period before it was set.

Scenario:
1. Assume that there are two top pools `poolA` with weight `50%` and `poolB` with weight `50%`.
2. Assume that `_lumPerSecond` = `1e18` at `time = 0 second`.
3. At `time = 10 sec`, an account calls function such as `deposit`, `withdraw`, etc to the `poolA`. Then, the `accDebtPerShare` for `poolA` is updated.
4. At `time = 20 sec`, `_lumPerSecond` is updated to `2e18`.
5. At `time = 30 sec`, all accounts of `poolA` and `poolB` call `claim` function.
6. Then, the LUM rewards of `poolA` are `1e18 * 50% * 10 + 2e18 * 50% * 20 = 25e18` and the one of `poolB` are `2e18 * 50% * 30 = 30e18`. Thus the LUM rewards of `poolA` and `poolB` are different and the sum of them are `55e18`.
This means that `_lumPerSecond` for `poolA` is `1e18` for `[0s,10s]` and `2e18` for `[10s,30s]`, and `_lumPerSecond` for `poolB` is `2e18` for `[0s,30s]`.
7. However the total LUM rewards sum should be `1e18 * 20 + 2e18 * 10 = 40e18` and the LUM rewards of `poolA` and `poolB` should be `40e18 / 2 = 20e18` respectively.
That is, the `_lumPerSecond` for `poolA` and `poolB` should be `1e18` for `[0s,20s]` and `2e18` for `[20s,30s]`.

## Impact
The new `_lumPerSecond` applies to the period before it was set.
And the applied periods are different according to the pools.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Modify the `MasterchefV2.sol#setLumPerSecond` function as follows.
```solidity
    function setLumPerSecond(uint96 lumPerSecond) external override onlyOwner {
        if (lumPerSecond > Constants.MAX_LUM_PER_SECOND) revert MasterChef__InvalidLumPerSecond();

--      // _updateAll(_voter.getTopPoolIds()); // todo remove this
++      _updateAll(_voter.getTopPoolIds()); // todo remove this

        _lumPerSecond = lumPerSecond;

        emit LumPerSecondSet(lumPerSecond);
    }
```
