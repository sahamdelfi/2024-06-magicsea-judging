# Rewards disruption when the admin calls `MasterChefV2::setLumPerSecond`

## Summary

When the admin changes the value of `_lumPerSecond` and the pools are not updated, it will disrupt rewards because some pools will receive a higher or lower amount of rewards than they should. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The rewards distribution within the `MasterChefV2` contract depends on a key variable, the LUM per second that is distributed between all pools. The admins can change that value by calling the function `setLumPerSecond`:

```solidity
function setLumPerSecond(uint96 lumPerSecond) external override onlyOwner {
    if (lumPerSecond > Constants.MAX_LUM_PER_SECOND) revert MasterChef__InvalidLumPerSecond();

    // _updateAll(_voter.getTopPoolIds()); // todo remove this

    _lumPerSecond = lumPerSecond;

    emit LumPerSecondSet(lumPerSecond);
}
```

However, if the admins call this function without calling `updateAll` first on all pools, it will cause a great disruption of rewards, which may provoke a loss of funds for some pools or too many rewards distributed for other pools. 

## Impact

The call to `setLumPerSecond` without the prior calling to `updateAll` will cause a disruption of rewards, which will translate into a loss of funds for some pools.

## Recommendation

To mitigate this issue is recommended to call `_updateAll` before actually changing the `_lumPerSecond` variable:

```diff
function setLumPerSecond(uint96 lumPerSecond) external override onlyOwner {
    if (lumPerSecond > Constants.MAX_LUM_PER_SECOND) revert MasterChef__InvalidLumPerSecond();

-   // _updateAll(_voter.getTopPoolIds()); // todo remove this
+   _updateAll(_voter.getTopPoolIds());

    _lumPerSecond = lumPerSecond;

    emit LumPerSecondSet(lumPerSecond);
}
```
