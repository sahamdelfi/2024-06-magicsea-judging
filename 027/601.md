# DOS: A certain users may not be able to create bribe rewarder forever

## Summary
Some certain users can be attacked to prevent them from creating bribe rewarder.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `createBribeRewarder` function of RewardFactory.sol calls `_cloneBribe` private function of the contract which uses Openzeppelin's `cloneDeterministic` function. The `cloneDeterministic` function uses create2 opcode so when its called with same salt twice or more it will revert because it can not clone twice at the same address. The `_cloneBribe` private function uses `msg.sender` and `_nonces[msg.sender]++` to generate the salt which allow someone (an attacker) to generate another salt with the msg.sender's address and his nonces(which can be read from the contract in blockchain and increment it by 1). The attacker can now call `cloneDeterministic` function from his attack contract with same parameters of `address(implementation)`, `immutableData` and the generated salt to prevent the user (victim) from calling `createBribeRewarder` function again.

## Impact
Some certain users can be attacked to prevent them from creating bribe rewarder.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/rewarders/RewarderFactory.sol#L152
```javascript
function _cloneBribe(RewarderType rewarderType, IERC20 token, address pool) private returns (IBribeRewarder rewarder) {
    if (rewarderType != RewarderType.BribeRewarder) revert RewarderFactory__InvalidRewarderType();

    IRewarder implementation = _implementations[rewarderType];

    if (address(implementation) == address(0)) revert RewarderFactory__ZeroAddress();

    IRewarder[] storage rewarders = _rewarders[rewarderType];

    bytes memory immutableData = abi.encodePacked(token, pool);
@>  bytes32 salt = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, _nonces[msg.sender]++));

    rewarder = IBribeRewarder(ImmutableClone.cloneDeterministic(address(implementation), immutableData, salt));

    rewarders.push(rewarder);
    _rewarderTypes[rewarder] = rewarderType;

    rewarder.initialize(msg.sender);
}
```
## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add `block.timestamp` in the salt.
