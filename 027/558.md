# The address of a new briberRewarder is predictable, and thus attacker can cause cloning to always revert

## Summary
While cloning a BriberRewarder (or any other type of rewarder) the address of the cloned contract is predictable, and hence an attacker can deploy another contract in this address, causing the user to not be able to deploy the briberRewarder.
## Vulnerability Detail
The address of the cloned contract is determined by the `immutableData `and the `salt` (by using create2 opcode).
Once we decide the msg.sender (the user trying to create the briberRewarder), the token and the pool, we can know the `_nonces[msg.sender] ` by counting the past deployments made the `msg.sender`, thus having all the data that is used by the immutableClone.sol to get the address of the cloned contract.
```solidity
bytes memory immutableData = abi.encodePacked(token, pool);
bytes32 salt = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, _nonces[msg.sender]++));

rewarder = IBribeRewarder(ImmutableClone.cloneDeterministic(address(implementation), immutableData, salt));
```
The attacker can deploy another contract to this address which will cause the users transaction to revert when he tries to clone a briberRewarder. 
This can if need be repeated for other pools, token combinations (if the attacker is interested), thus blocking the user from creating briberRewarder.
## Impact
This will block a user from creating a BriberRewarder permenantly, since none of the variables used in determining the address ever changes.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To make the address not predictable another variable can be added in the creation of the salt.
eg:
`bytes32 salt = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, _nonces[msg.sender]++, block.timestamp));`
