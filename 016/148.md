# Optional function `decimals` can cause deployment issues in `MlumStaking`

## Summary

The contract [MlumStaking](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/MlumStaking.sol) is used by the users to stake their `MLUM` and earn reward tokens in exchange. Within the constructor of the contract, the decimals of the reward token are [retrieved](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/MlumStaking.sol#L91), but this can cause issues with any `ERC20` token that does not implement the decimals function.

## Vulnerability Detail

When deploying a new [MlumStaking](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/MlumStaking.sol) pool, if the reward token does not support the `decimals` function, a revert will occur, thereby preventing the creation of the pool. According to the `EIP-20`, the [decimals](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20#decimals) method is entirely optional:
> OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability, but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

One such token is USDC, which is a planned reward token by the protocol, as confirmed by the contest's readme and its [documentation](https://docs.magicsea.finance/protocol/magic/magic-lum-staking):
>All protocol returns like a part of the trading fees, Fairlaunch listing fees, and NFT trading fees flow into the staking pool in form of USDC.

## Impact

Broken functionality of the contract, which limits the protocol's capabilities.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

For such tokens, I suggest adding one additional parameter to the constructor, which will define the decimals of the reward token. If `USDC` is the only token that is going to be provided as a reward, its decimals can be simply hardcoded.

An additional idea to handle the case, is implemeting a function similliar to [_tryGetAssetDecimals](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC4626.sol#L86-L97), used by `OpenZeppelin` in `ERC4626`
