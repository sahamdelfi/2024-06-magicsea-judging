# `decimals()` function is an optional part of ERC20 token standard

## Summary
`decimals()` function is an optional part of ERC20 token standard, which means that not every ERC20 is going to comply with the protocol
## Vulnerability Detail
In `MlumStaking`'s constructor there is the following block of code:
```javascript
  uint256 decimalsRewardToken = uint256(
            IERC20Metadata(address(_rewardToken)).decimals()
        );
```
It is meant to get the decimals of the token, but since the `decimals()` function is an optional part of ERC20 standard, there are tokens that won't be able to participate in the protocol
## Impact
violation of the `README`, by not allowing `any` token to comply with the protocol

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use try/catch statement to avoid revert on such tokens
