# MlumStaking.sol will have issues with reward tokens with no decimal

## Summary
According to EIP-20 _decimals_ is optional
https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20#decimals

## Vulnerability Detail
There will be issues with MlumStaking.sol's constructor if the reward token is a token that doesn't have decimals.
```solidity
constructor(IERC20 _stakedToken, IERC20 _rewardToken) {
       
     ...................................code

        uint256 decimalsRewardToken = uint256(IERC20Metadata(address(_rewardToken)).decimals()); // @audit-issue 
        require(decimalsRewardToken < 30, "Must be inferior to 30");

      ...............................code
    }

```


According to EIP20, decimals is optional:
 #### decimals
_Returns the number of decimals the token uses - e.g. 8, means to divide the token amount by 100000000 to get its user representation._

**OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability, but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.**
```solidity
function decimals() public view returns (uint8)
```

## Impact
MlumStaking.sol cannot be deployed with reward tokens that have no decimals

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
use try-catch to call the reward token's decimal(). In the catch{} area add logic to assign 18 decimals as the reward tokens decimals just in case the token has none.
