# Partial to total loss of user rewards in pools with high decimal tokens due to Truncation

## Summary
When a V2 pool with tokens with high supplies or high decimals gets added to the masterchefv2  users who will stake this pools liquidity in the MasterChef are going to lose all their rewards because of rounding down to zero

## Vulnerability Detail
V2 pools in magic sea are a fork of uniswapv2, the amount of Lptokens to be minted upon first liquidity deposit is [as follows](https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-core/blob/ee547b17853e71ed4e0101ccfd52e70d5acded58/contracts/UniswapV2Pair.sol#L120) where $x_0$ is the amount of token0 and $y_0$ the amount of token1 deposited:

$L = \sqrt{x_0 \cdot y_0}$

Note here that the equation doesn't take into account the decimals of the tokens, this means that the higher decimals we have the higher the result will be.

Future liquidity deposits are calculated by getting the ratio of the added tokens to the already provided tokens for each token and then taking the lower ratio and multiplying it by the already existing tokens, so huge amount of lp tokens are also going to be minted for them

if such pools are added to the MasterChef then the amount of LP tokens deposited will be big since the total supply is huge and the problem here will be in the `getDebtPerShare` if the total deposits are sufficiently big that the rewards are going to round down to zero
```solidity
    function getDebtPerShare(uint256 totalDeposit, uint256 totalRewards) internal pure returns (uint256) {
        return totalDeposit == 0 ? 0 : (totalRewards << Constants.ACC_PRECISION_BITS) / totalDeposit;
    }
```
The following scenario will illustrate the vulnerability
- We have token1 and token0 both have a 36 precesion

- Pool A has a total of $1,000,000$ of token1 and $1,000,000$ of token0 that were provided by bob who was the first to provide liquidity and received $1e42$ in lp tokens then other users come and add more liquidity
- Now as time goes the pool becomes popular and starts receiving votes and gets added to the `MasterchefV2` while having 10% of the total weight and the rewards per second is $3e18$ meaning the pool reward per second is $3e17$
- Bob comes and is the first to deposit and deposits half his lp tokens which in this case are which will be equal to $1e42/2 = 5e41$
- if then after 1.0457176 days or less, someone deposits the debt per share will be rounded down to zero and then if someone does it again in 1.0457176 days or less it will round down to zero and will keep going on like this because every time someone deposits, withdraw or claims the deb per share and last update timestamp are updated making calculations start from scratch again
- If we assume there is at least 1 deposit or claim or withdrawal or update for the pool every 1.0457176 days or less which is super plausible then when Bob or a user comes and tries to claim his rewards he will always get 0 because all his rewards were lost because of precision loss
### Poc for the attack scenario
remove _disableInitializers(); from the constructor of the masterchefv2 since the POC doesn't use a proxy and create a new file in the test folder and paste this

## Impact
The rounding down to zero in pools with tokens with high decimals will cause users to lose all there funds.

Above we mentioned 1.0457176 days and this value is an approximate threshold because the totalrewards value in the `getDebtPerShare` is determined by the weight and the rewards per second and the time that passed,the higher those values the less likely there will be rounding down to zero but also the higher the amount deposited of lp tokens the higher the chance there will be rounding down to zero

As the time passed value is the most dynamic one we can take it as a threshold after assuming all other values to be nearly constant as we did in the example above to get an approximate value

This threshold might be in seconds to year depending on the decimals and totall deposit and the values mentioned above and it is combined with the pools activity in the masterchef what will determine if users will loose all their rewards or a part of them.

Although when the time passed goes above this threshold the result will be 1 there will still be a precision loss in if the value goes up to $(Threashold*2)-1$ it will still round down to 1 leading to nearly 50% of the rewards lost.

Here is the original equation for the debt per share and note that the reward per second for the pool depends on the reward per second,the total weight and the weight of the pool
$((RewardPerSecondForPool*Timepassed)* 2^{64}) / totalDeposit$

If we try to solve $timepassed$ for when there will be rounding down to zero ie the value of the equation above is less than one we get the following:

$Timepassed < \frac{totalDeposit}{RewardPerSecondForPool \cdot 2^{64}}$

## Recommendation
Put a limit on the decimals of the tokens that constitute the pool before it is added
