# PUSH0 opcode Is Not Supported on IOTA EVM yet

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
The current codebase is compiled with Solidity version 0.8.20, which includes the PUSH0 opcode in the compiled bytecode.  But the protocol will be deployed on the IOTA network. On this network PUSH0 opcode is not supported yet.

## Impact
Deploying the protocol on IOTA with the current Solidity version (0.8.20) may result in unexpected behavior or failure due to the unsupported PUSH0 opcode.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended that the protocol would be compiled with version 0.8.19
