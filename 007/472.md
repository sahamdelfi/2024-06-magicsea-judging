# If the approver renews or extends a lock position, the position's current rewards are transferred to the approver instead of the position owner.

## Summary
If the approver renews or extends a lock position, the position's current rewards are transferred to the approver instead of the position owner. This can lead to a loss of rewards for the position owner.

## Vulnerability Detail
As shown in `MlumStaking.sol:510` and `MlumStaking.sol:513`, the `renewLockPosition` and `extendLockPosition` operation  can be initiated by both the position owner and the approver. At the end of these two functions, `_lockPosition` function is called to update the lock from the postion.
```solidity
509:    function renewLockPosition(uint256 tokenId) external nonReentrant {
510:@>      _requireOnlyApprovedOrOwnerOf(tokenId);
511:
512:        _updatePool();
513:@>      _lockPosition(tokenId, _stakingPositions[tokenId].lockDuration, false);
514:    }
```

```solidity
524:    function extendLockPosition(uint256 tokenId, uint256 lockDuration) external nonReentrant {
525:@>      _requireOnlyApprovedOrOwnerOf(tokenId);
526:
527:        _updatePool();
528:@>      _lockPosition(tokenId, lockDuration, true);
529:    }
```

In `_lockPosition`, the current rewards of the position will be harvested to the `msg.sender`. But the `msg.sender` could be the position owner or the approver. So if the renewing or extending operation is initiated by the approver, the rewards will goes to the approver instead of the position owner.
```solidity
// Function: MlumStaking.sol#_lockPosition
710:        _harvestPosition(tokenId, msg.sender);  // @audit-issue rewards go to `msg.sender`
```

## Impact
If `renewLockPosition` or `extendLockPosition` is initiated by the position approver, the position owner will lose his position rewards.

## Recommendation
In `_lockPosition`, harvest the position to the position owner instead of `msg.sender`.
