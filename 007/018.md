# Lack of parameter in `MlumStaking::renewLockPosition` leads to lack of change in `IMlumStaking::StakingPosition`  which results in loss of rewards for stakers

## Summary
Wrong argument to a call to internal function `MlumStaking::_lockPosition` through `MlumStaking::renewLockPosition` leads to loss of rewards.

## Vulnerability Detail
Staker creates a position in the protocol but has the ability to renew the `IMlumStaking::StakingPosition` by using the function `MlumStaking::renewLockPosition`, this function uses an internal function `_lockPositon` to renew the `StakingPosition` .  During the call to this internal function `_lockPosition(tokenId, _stakingPositions[tokenId].lockDuration, false);` it passes the wrong second argument, in which instead of passing new lockDuration, it passes the same old lockDuration of staker. This keeps the status of `stakingPosition` the same despite renewing it. This could lead to a loss of rewards for the staker as rewards for staking positions depend on the duration for which the assets are staked in the protocol.

## Impact 
Loss of rewards for stakers

## Proof of Concept
```javascript
function testDoesNotRenewLockDuration() public {
        _stakingToken.mint(ALICE, 2 ether);

        vm.startPrank(ALICE);
        _stakingToken.approve(address(_pool), 1 ether);
        _pool.createPosition(1 ether, 2 days);
        vm.stopPrank();

        MlumStaking.StakingPosition memory position = _pool.getStakingPosition(1);
        uint256 lockDurationBeforeRenewLockPositionFunction = position.lockDuration;

        vm.startPrank(ALICE);
        _pool.renewLockPosition(1);
        vm.stopPrank();

        uint256 lockDurationAfterRenewLockPositionFunction = position.lockDuration;

        //Lock duration should have been different but this assertion passes
        assert(lockDurationAfterRenewLockPositionFunction == lockDurationBeforeRenewLockPositionFunction);
    }
```

```javascript
function testDoesNotChangeTheRewardsForTheStakerIfHeRenewsTheLockDuration() public {
        _stakingToken.mint(ALICE, 2 ether);
        _stakingToken.mint(BOB, 2 ether);

        vm.startPrank(ALICE);
        _stakingToken.approve(address(_pool), 2 ether);
        _pool.createPosition(1 ether, 2 days);
        vm.stopPrank();

        skip(2 days);
        vm.prank(ALICE);
        _pool.withdrawFromPosition(1, 1 ether);
        

        vm.startPrank(BOB);
        _stakingToken.approve(address(_pool), 2 ether);
        _pool.createPosition(1 ether, 2 days);
        vm.stopPrank();

        //We try to renew the LockPosition
        vm.startPrank(BOB);
        _pool.renewLockPosition(2);
        vm.stopPrank();

        skip(2 days);
        vm.prank(BOB);
        _pool.withdrawFromPosition(2, 1 ether);

        /**As the postion for BOB has been renewed this assertion should have failed as rewards for both stakers 
         * should have been different but it passes indicating the loss of rewards for stakers*/
        assert(_stakingToken.balanceOf(BOB) == _stakingToken.balanceOf(ALICE));



    }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
```diff
-  function renewLockPosition(uint256 tokenId) external nonReentrant {
+ function renewLockPosition(uint256 tokenId, uint256 lockDuration) external nonReentrant {
         _requireOnlyApprovedOrOwnerOf(tokenId);

         _updatePool();
-       _lockPosition(tokenId, _stakingPositions[tokenId].lockDuration, false);
+      _lockPosition(tokenId, lockDuration, false);
 }
```
