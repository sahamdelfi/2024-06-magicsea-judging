# Harvested rewards are not sent to the position owner.

## Summary
Harvested rewards are not sent to the position owner if `extendLockPosition` or `renewLockPosition` get called by the approved address. 
## Vulnerability Detail
If the approved address calls either `extendLockPosition` or `renewLockPosition`, the underlying `_lockPosition` function will get called. This function not only updates the lock position but also triggers further actions by calling `_harvestReward` with `msg.sender` as the recipient. Since the caller in this case is the approved address, the reward will mistakenly be sent to the approved address. This behavior is incorrect because the reward should ideally go to the original owner or intended recipient, not the approved address.

```jsx
    function extendLockPosition(
        uint256 tokenId,
        uint256 lockDuration
    ) external nonReentrant {
        _requireOnlyApprovedOrOwnerOf(tokenId);

        _updatePool();
        _lockPosition(tokenId, lockDuration, true);
    }
```

```jsx
 function _lockPosition(uint256 tokenId, uint256 lockDuration, bool resetInitial) internal {
        ...SNIP...
       //@audit reward should go to owner
        _harvestPosition(tokenId, msg.sender);

        // update position and total lp supply
        position.lockDuration = lockDuration;
        position.lockMultiplier = getMultiplierByLockDuration(lockDuration);
        position.startLockTime = currentBlockTimestamp;
        _updateBoostMultiplierInfoAndRewardDebt(position);

        emit LockPosition(tokenId, lockDuration);
    }

```

## Impact
The owner of the NFT will lose the matured yield, which is a critical issue.

## Recommendation
Make sure that only the owner of tokenId receives the yields.
