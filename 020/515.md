# MasterchefV2 cannot transfer Lum token ownership

## Summary

`MasterchefV2` cannot transfer the ownership of Lum token and will DoS the tokens in case there is an issue or migration is needed.

## Vulnerability Detail

Looking at the Lum [token](https://explorer.evm.iota.org/token/0x34a85ddc4E30818e44e6f4A8ee39d8CBA9A60fB3?tab=read_contract) and the current owner we can see that it is an EOA [account](https://explorer.evm.iota.org/address/0xC0A46D280BdbF7c0B6184bd8d58F093D81C7BA5A). When `MasterchefV2` is deployed the ownership of the Lum token will be transferred to the contract, otherwise, minting will not be possible due to the `onlyOwner` modifier applied:

```solidity
contract LumOFT is OFT, ILum {

  constructor(
      address _lzEndpoint,
      address _delegate ) 
      OFT("Lum", "LUM", _lzEndpoint, _delegate) 
      Ownable(_delegate) { }

function mint(address to, uint256 amount) external override onlyOwner returns (uint256) {
      if (amount > 0) _mint(to, amount);

      return amount;
  }
}
```

But the problem is that `MasterchefV2` has no functionality to transfer the tokenâ€™s ownership to someone else and it will be the owner **forever.** Imagine the situation when new version of the `Masterchef` is being added, similar to the SushiSwap migration or there is some emergency situation such as issue in the current contract, compromising not only the staking contract but `Lum`  token as well.

## Impact

Once added as owner, `MasterchefV2` cannot transfer the ownership of the Lum token to someone else due to missing functionality.
