# Upgradable implementation Contracts should not have `constructor` in them

## Summary : Upgradable smart contracts have 2 parts. One of them is the implementation and the other one is the Proxy contract.The implementation contract holds all the logics and gets replaced every time the cotracts gets updated. That's why we use initialzers to set up the implementation contract and all the storage stays in the proxy contract which points to the implementation contract.

## Vulnerability Detail : By using a constructor in an implementation contract, we are risking losing valuable `storage` data when we upgrade our smart contract. Also, proxies are not well equipped to access storage from the implementation contracts. So, the risks remain no matter how small amount of data we store using the constructor.

## Impact: Using constructors, we store information in that particular contract and thus when we replace that contract with a new one we risk of losing it forever even if we again deploy another contract, the proxies are not that capable to access them properly and there is still a risk of storage collison.

## Code Snippet: `BaseRewarder.sol` has this 
`constructor(address caller) {
        _caller = caller;
        implementation = address(this); //@audit as this is an implementation contract, this shouldn't have any constructor

        _disableInitializers();
    }

    /**
     * @dev Initializes the BaseRewarder contract.
     * @param initialOwner The initial owner of the contract.
     */
    function initialize(address initialOwner) public virtual override initializer {
        //@audit the initialize function can be called more than one time.
        __Ownable_init(initialOwner);
    }`

`BribeRewarder.sol` has this

`constructor(address caller) {
        _caller = caller;
        implementation = address(this);

        _disableInitializers();
    }

    /**
     * @dev Initializes the BaseRewarder contract.
     * @param initialOwner The initial owner of the contract.
     */
    function initialize(address initialOwner) public virtual initializer {
        __Ownable_init(initialOwner);
    }
`

Manual Review

## Recommendation: We highly encourage to store what ever information inside logic contracts using `initializer` function. As it does exacly the same with a bit more modualrity and it follows the basic standars of upgradable smart contracts.
