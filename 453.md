# Rewarder wrongly updates reward.debt and returns incorrectly calculated rewards

## Summary
```Rewarder::update()``` calculates wrongly the rewards and updates incorrectly reward.debt parameter.

## Vulnerability Detail
update() function is called by ```MasterChefV2::_modify()``` when the position of an account is modified. ```update()``` is expected to recalculate the ```accDebtPerShare```, which is the reward per share that rewarder allocates, as well as ```rewarder.debt[account]```, which is the reward for the account whose position is being modified. This calculations are not done properly, as it uses the previous balance instead of the updated one, therefore uses receive less reward than what they should.

## Impact
High impact, since it happens almost all times that a user gets their position updated.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Correct the way in which ```rewards``` and ```reward.debt[account]``` are calculated:

```solidity
uint256 accDebtPerShare = updateAccDebtPerShare(rewarder, totalSupply, totalRewards);
- rewards = oldBalance == 0 ? 0 : getDebt(accDebtPerShare, oldBalance) - rewarder.debt[account];
+ rewards = oldBalance == 0 ? 0 : getDebt(accDebtPerShare, newBalance) - rewarder.debt[account];
- rewarder.debt[account] = getDebt(accDebtPerShare, newBalance);
+ rewarder.debt[account] = rewarder.debt[account] + rewards;
```
