# Voter.sol::getVotesPerPeriod() is actually returning the votes of the period in a particular pool instead of the total votes in that period.

## Summary
getVotesPerPeriod() is actually returning the votes of the period in a particular pool instead of the total votes in that period.
This is because we are not updating `_totalVotesInPeriod` when the user marks his vote in that period.
## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
    /// @dev period => total amount of votes
    mapping(uint256 => uint256) private _totalVotesInPeriod; 
```

 1) `_totalVotesInPeriod` is not updated whenever a user marks his vote using `vote()`.

2) No function to get `_totalVotesInPeriod`

3) Also `getVotesPerPeriod()` is returning wrong value than expected.
 
```solidity
    function getVotesPerPeriod(uint256 periodId, address pool) external view override returns (uint256) {
        //..@audit _totalVotesInPeriod is not updated anywhere and _totalVotesInPeriod is supposed to be returned
        return _poolVotesPerPeriod[periodId][pool];
    }
```
Returning votes in a particular pool instead of total votes

## Impact
getVotesPerPeriod() is actually returning the votes of the period in a particular pool instead of the total votes in that period.

## Recommendation

Update `_totalVotesInPeriod` when user votes and add a getter to get this value.
