# Lack of Pool Updates When Adding New Pools

## Summary

The [add function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/MasterchefV2.sol#L367) in the MasterChefV2 contract allows the addition of new staking pools. However, it does not update the existing pools before adding a new one. This oversight can lead to inconsistent reward distribution, causing users in existing pools to receive fewer rewards than they are entitled to.

## Vulnerability Detail

The contract distributes rewards based on the allocation points assigned to each pool. When a new pool is added, the total allocation points increase, affecting the reward distribution across all pools.

However, if the existing pools are not updated before adding a new pool, the rewards for these pools are calculated based on outdated total allocation points, leading to incorrect reward distribution.

Case Study:-

- Owner adds a new pool (first pool) for staking with points = 100 (totalPoints=100).
- Alice stakes 10 tokens in the first pool 1 block later. 1 week passes.
- Alice withdraws her 10 tokens and claims X amount of reward tokens.
- Bob stakes 10 tokens in the first pool 1 block later. 1 week passes.
- Owner adds a new pool (second pool) for staking with points = 100 (totalPoints=200).
- Bob withdraws his 10 tokens and claims X/2 amount of reward tokens instead of X amount.

## Impact

Inconsistent Reward Distribution.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/MasterchefV2.sol#L367

```solidity
function add(IERC20 token, IMasterChefRewarder extraRewarder) external override {
        if (msg.sender != address(_lbHooksManager)) _checkOwnerOrOperator();

        //_checkOwner(); // || msg.sender != address(_voter)

        uint256 pid = _farms.length;

        Farm storage farm = _farms.push();

        farm.token = token;
        farm.rewarder.lastUpdateTimestamp = block.timestamp;

        if (address(extraRewarder) != address(0)) _setExtraRewarder(pid, extraRewarder);

        token.balanceOf(address(this)); // sanity check

        emit FarmAdded(pid, token);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is crucial to update all existing pools before adding a new pool. This ensures that the reward variables for the existing pools are adjusted correctly before changing the total allocation points.

```solidity
function add(IERC20 token, IMasterChefRewarder extraRewarder) external override {
    if (msg.sender != address(_lbHooksManager)) _checkOwnerOrOperator();

    // Update all existing pools before adding a new one
    uint256[] memory allPids = new uint256[](_farms.length);
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < _farms.length; i++) {
        allPids[i] = i;
    }
    _updateAll(allPids);

    uint256 pid = _farms.length;

    Farm storage farm = _farms.push();

    farm.token = token;
    farm.rewarder.lastUpdateTimestamp = block.timestamp;

    if (address(extraRewarder) != address(0)) _setExtraRewarder(pid, extraRewarder);

    token.balanceOf(address(this)); // sanity check

    emit FarmAdded(pid, token);
}
```
