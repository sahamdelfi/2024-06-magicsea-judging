# `MasterChef`: Inaccurate Reward Calculations Due to Token Overlap

## Summary
In the MasterChef contract, the `add()` function allows the addition of new farms by specifying a `token`. However, there is no check to ensure that the `token` being added is not the same as the reward token (LUM). This oversight can lead to incorrect reward calculations in the `_updateAll()` function. When the farm token is the same as LUM, the rewards minted to the contract inflate the total supply value, causing the reward calculations to be inaccurate and resulting in less reward than intended for the affected pool.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the MasterChef contract, a new farm can be added using the `add()` function. The token of the farm is defined using the `token` variable. However, there is no additional checking whether the `token` is the same as the reward token (LUM) or not.
```solidity
  function add(IERC20 token, IMasterChefRewarder extraRewarder) external override {
        if (msg.sender != address(_lbHooksManager)) _checkOwnerOrOperator();

        //_checkOwner(); // || msg.sender != address(_voter)

        uint256 pid = _farms.length;

        Farm storage farm = _farms.push();

        farm.token = token;
        farm.rewarder.lastUpdateTimestamp = block.timestamp;

        if (address(extraRewarder) != address(0)) _setExtraRewarder(pid, extraRewarder);

        token.balanceOf(address(this)); // sanity check

        emit FarmAdded(pid, token);
    }
```
When the `token` is the same token as LUM, reward calculation for that pool in the `_updateAll()` function can be incorrect. This is because the total farm amounts is used in the calculation of the reward. Since the `token` is the same token as the reward, the reward minted to the contract will inflate the value of `totalSupply `, causing the reward of that pool to be less than what it should be.
```solidity
  function _updateAll(uint256[] memory pids) private {
        uint256 length = pids.length;

        uint256 totalWeight = _voter.getTotalWeight();
        uint256 lumPerSecond = _lumPerSecond;

        for (uint256 i; i < length; ++i) {
            uint256 pid = pids[i];

            Farm storage farm = _farms[pid];
            Rewarder.Parameter storage rewarder = farm.rewarder;

            uint256 totalSupply = farm.amounts.getTotalAmount();
            uint256 totalRewards = rewarder.getTotalRewards(lumPerSecond, totalSupply);

            uint256 totalLumRewardForPid = _getRewardForPid(pid, totalRewards, totalWeight);
            uint256 lumRewardForPid = _mintLum(totalLumRewardForPid);

            rewarder.updateAccDebtPerShare(totalSupply, lumRewardForPid);
        }
    }
```

## Impact

The lack of a check to prevent the farm token from being the same as the reward token (LUM) can lead to significant issues in reward distribution. Specifically, when LUM is both the farm token and the reward token, the total supply used in reward calculations is inflated by the rewards minted to the contract. This results in the rewards for that pool being lower than expected. Such a discrepancy can lead to unfair reward distributions, affecting the trust and integrity of the MasterChef contract and potentially causing losses for users participating in the affected farm.

## Recommendation
Add a check that `token` is not LUM in the `add()` function.
