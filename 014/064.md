# Lack of Validation for Staking and Reward Token Overlap

## Summary

The [add function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/MasterchefV2.sol#L367) in the MasterChefV2 contract allows the addition of new staking pools. However, it does not check if the staking token for the new pool is the same as the reward token (`LUM`). This oversight can lead to incorrect reward calculations for the pool because the minted rewards can inflate the balance of the staking token, thus affecting the reward distribution.

## Vulnerability Detail

The contract enables the addition of new pools through the `add` function, where the staking token is specified by the `token` parameter. If this token is the same as the reward token (`LUM`), the reward calculations become skewed due to the reward token being included in the total supply of the staking token. This issue is not handled in the current implementation.

Proof of Concept: 
- Owner adds a new pool with the staking token being the same as the reward token (LUM).
- Users stake LUM tokens in the new pool.
- As rewards are minted and distributed, the balance of LUM in the contract increases.
- The increased balance of LUM inflates the total supply calculation for the pool.
- The inflated total supply causes the reward calculations to distribute fewer rewards than intended.

## Impact

When the `token` is the same token as LUM, reward calculation for that pool in the `_updateAll()` function can be incorrect.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/MasterchefV2.sol#L367

```solidity
/**
     * @dev Adds a farm.
     * @param token The token of the farm.
     * @param extraRewarder The extra rewarder of the farm.
     */
    function add(IERC20 token, IMasterChefRewarder extraRewarder) external override {
        if (msg.sender != address(_lbHooksManager)) _checkOwnerOrOperator();

        //_checkOwner(); // || msg.sender != address(_voter)

        uint256 pid = _farms.length;

        Farm storage farm = _farms.push();

        farm.token = token;
        farm.rewarder.lastUpdateTimestamp = block.timestamp;

        if (address(extraRewarder) != address(0)) _setExtraRewarder(pid, extraRewarder);

        token.balanceOf(address(this)); // sanity check

        emit FarmAdded(pid, token);
    }
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/MasterchefV2.sol#L510
```solidity
function _updateAll(uint256[] memory pids) private {
        uint256 length = pids.length;

        uint256 totalWeight = _voter.getTotalWeight();
        uint256 lumPerSecond = _lumPerSecond;

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; ++i) {
            uint256 pid = pids[i];

            Farm storage farm = _farms[pid];
            Rewarder.Parameter storage rewarder = farm.rewarder;

            uint256 totalSupply = farm.amounts.getTotalAmount();
            uint256 totalRewards = rewarder.getTotalRewards(lumPerSecond, totalSupply);

            uint256 totalLumRewardForPid = _getRewardForPid(pid, totalRewards, totalWeight);
            uint256 lumRewardForPid = _mintLum(totalLumRewardForPid);

            rewarder.updateAccDebtPerShare(totalSupply, lumRewardForPid);
        }
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The add function should include a validation check to ensure that the staking token for the new pool is not the same as the reward token (LUM).

```solidity
function add(IERC20 token, IMasterChefRewarder extraRewarder) external override {
    if (msg.sender != address(_lbHooksManager)) _checkOwnerOrOperator();

    // Validate that the staking token is not the same as the reward token
    require(address(token) != address(_lum), "MasterChef: Staking token cannot be the same as reward token");

    uint256 pid = _farms.length;

    Farm storage farm = _farms.push();

    farm.token = token;
    farm.rewarder.lastUpdateTimestamp = block.timestamp;

    if (address(extraRewarder) != address(0)) _setExtraRewarder(pid, extraRewarder);

    token.balanceOf(address(this)); // sanity check

    emit FarmAdded(pid, token);
}
```
