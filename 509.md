# Ensuring Correct Balance Calculation to Prevent Potential DoS

## Summary
The _setRewardParameters and sweep functions in the contract must ensure that the balance calculations are accurate to prevent potential underflows and DoS (Denial of Service) vulnerabilities. Specifically, the contract must ensure that the balance is greater than or equal to _totalUnclaimedRewards and _reserve when performing calculations. Failure to do so could lead to incorrect reward calculations and potential DoS scenarios.

## Vulnerability Detail
The primary issue arises from potential underflows in the balance calculations within the _setRewardParameters and sweep functions. If the contract's balance is not correctly validated against _totalUnclaimedRewards and _reserve, it could result in:

- Incorrect reward per second calculations.
- Inaccurate reserve values.
- Underflows that prevent the proper execution of the sweep function.

## Impact
- Incorrect balance calculations can lead to transaction failures, preventing users from claiming or sweeping rewards.
- Users may be unable to retrieve their entitled rewards, leading to potential financial losses.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Balance Check in _setRewardParameters:
Ensure that the contract's balance is greater than or equal to _totalUnclaimedRewards before performing any calculations that could underflow.

`require(balance >= totalUnclaimedRewards, "Insufficient balance to cover unclaimed rewards");
`

Reserve Check in sweep:
Verify that _reserve does not exceed the contract's balance before subtracting it.

`require(_reserve <= balance, "Reserve exceeds balance");
