# _accRewardsPerShare is computed wrongly if unlockOperator calls emergencyWithdraw

## Summary
`MlumStaking::emergencyWithdraw` is implemented for specific situation and unlockOperators can call that and LPs can call that when isUnlock is true but this cause _accRewardsPerShare be expired
## Vulnerability Detail
**Textual POC:**
_accRewardsPerShare computes based on contract reward token's balance divide into _stakedSupplyWithMultiplier
Let assume 
1 - Alice deposits 1000 mlum with lockDuration 365 days 

amount = 1000, amountWithMultiplier = 3000, lockMultiplier=20000 , _stakedSupplyWithMultiplier = 3000

_accRewardsPerShare = 0 because of lastRewardBalance == rewardBalance[both of them is zero]

2- Bob deposits 1000 mlum with lockDuration 365 days 

amount = 1000, amountWithMultiplier = 3000, lockMultiplier=20000 , _stakedSupplyWithMultiplier = 3000

_accRewardsPerShare = 0 because of lastRewardBalance == rewardBalance

3-contract gets 6000 usdc as a reward

_accRewardsPerShare = 6000 / 6000 = 1

4 - after a while isUnlock will be true and bob calls `MlumStaking::emergencyWithdraw`

_stakedSupplyWithMultiplier will be updated and _stakedSupplyWithMultiplier will be 3000 but in this moment _accRewardsPerShare is 1 while that has to be 6000 / 3000 = 2

6- Alice calls `MlumStaking::withdrawFromPosition` after lockDuration and she gets 3000 usdc as a reward while she has to get 6000 usdc as reward


## Impact
MlumStaking just when lastRewardBalance is opposite to rewardBalance will update accRewardsPerShare hence LPs get less reward than actual amount

## Recommendation

```diff
    function emergencyWithdraw(uint256 tokenId) external override nonReentrant {
       ...
        _stakedSupply = _stakedSupply - amount;
        _stakedSupplyWithMultiplier = _stakedSupplyWithMultiplier - position.amountWithMultiplier;

        // destroy position (ignore boost points)
        _destroyPosition(tokenId);
        _accRewardsPerShare =
+        rewardToken.balanceOf(address(this)) / (_stakedSupplyWithMultiplier));
        emit EmergencyWithdraw(tokenId, amount);
        stakedToken.safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);
    }
```
