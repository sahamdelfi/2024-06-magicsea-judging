# `Create2` address collision against a to-be-deployed rewarder allows for complete draining of the rewarder.

## Summary  
An attacker with a pre-computed exhaustive Rainbow table for all the salts that will make him deploy a proxy contract at a certain address from his wallet will be able to front run `createRewarder` and `createBribeRewarder`, deploy a proxy that points to an implementation that approves him an infinite amount of reward token for the to-be-deployed rewarder in the address it will be deployed on and then self destruct and let the rewarder get deployed.

When the rewarder receives the rewards to be distributed to the user, an attacker will be able to drain all the rewards.  
## Vulnerability Detail  
`createRewarder` uses `_clone` which uses `cloneDeterministic` function to deploy a new rewarder using create2 and adds some values at the end of its bytecode which are called immutable arguments.

The address for the contract to be deployed using Create2 is determined by the last 20 bytes of the following as mentioned in the [eip-1014](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1014):  
$address = Keccak256(0xff || address || salt || Keccak256(initcode))$

Now in the context of `createRewarder` the address is going to be the factories address and the salt is going to be calculated using the $(nonce+1)$ and the address of the sender of the transaction as is clear form below:  
```solidity  
RewarderFactory.sol#L142>  
bytes32 salt = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, _nonces[msg.sender]++));  
```  
Now for the init code `cloneDeterministic` provides a bytecode for a Minimal proxy preceded by the address of the implementation and followed by the immutable arguments which are the reward token and the pool id as is shown here:  
```solidity  
bytes memory immutableData = abi.encodePacked(token, pid);  
```  
`createBribeRewarder` uses `_cloneBribe` with the only difference being that the immutable arguments passed are the reward token and the pool address instead of id

Now we can see if a transaction is submitted an attacker will have access to all the data that will let him to compute the address the rewarder will be created at.

Now an attacker can keep brute force searching until he comes up with an exhaustive Rainbow table of what salt is needed to generate any address that can exist within the 20 bytes domain while having the init code as a proxy and the address as his address.

The feasibility, as well as the detailed technique and hardware requirements for doing so, are sufficiently described in multiple references:

- [1](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-kyber-swap-judging/issues/90): A past issue on Sherlock describing this attack.  
- [2](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3607): EIP-3607, whose rationale is this exact attack. The EIP is in final state.  
- [3](https://mystenlabs.com/blog/ambush-attacks-on-160bit-objectids-addresses): A blog post discussing the cost (money and time) of this exact attack.  
### Draining the Rewarder  
- Now the rewarder will be waiting for a transaction for creating a rewarder to come into the memepool and when it does he can compute the address of the to-be-deployed rewarder.  
- He checks his list for the salt that outputs the corresponding wallet  
- He front runs the transaction deploying a proxy and setting an implementation that has a function that lets him approve uint max amount of a token of choice to his address and has self-destruct functionality, which is then called to approve himself max uint amount of the reward token of the to be deployed rewarder and destructs the contract all in one transaction so that self destruct works  
- The rewarder gets deployed, and after some time, rewards to be distributed are sent to it.  
- Once that happens the attacker can use his approval to transfer all the reward tokens to him and by doing so drain all the rewarder  
## Impact  
With the advancement of computing hardware, the cost of an attack has been shown to be [just a few million dollars](https://mystenlabs.com/blog/ambush-attacks-on-160bit-objectids-addresses), and that the current Bitcoin network hashrate allows about  $2^{80}$ in about half an hour. The cost of the attack may be offsetted with longer brute force time.

Though it might seem absurd for an attacker to spend millions to steal some hundreds of thousands the twist is that once the attacker gets the rainbow list he can keep using it to excute multiple attacks which will make him at the end make a profit, and MagicSea will only be a stepping stone on his process.

## Tool used  
Manual Analysis  
## Recommendation  
Use the original version of [ClonesWithImmutableArgs](https://github.com/Saw-mon-and-Natalie/clones-with-immutable-args/blob/main/src/ClonesWithImmutableArgs.sol) which uses `CREATE` instead of `CREATE2`
