# LPs might be unable to claim or withdraw or even top deposits due to blacklisted tokens

## Summary

LPs might not be able to claim or withdraw or even top their deposits if they're blacklisted by the masterChefRewarder token

## Vulnerability Detail

The masterChefRewarder reward token can include a variety of tokens including tokens like USDC (as stated in the team), The issue is that some tokens including USDC can blacklist addresses, that means if the LP is blacklisted by the masterChefRewarder reward token they'll be unable to claim their rewards, withdraw their staked tokens or top their deposits as all these require the `_modify` function which attempts to claim the user's reward tokens when possible, as seen [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/MasterchefV2.sol#L560-L560) by callling `MasterChefRewarder::onModify`. 

## Impact

LPs will not be able to claim or withdraw or top their deposits as this would require claiming thier rewards
