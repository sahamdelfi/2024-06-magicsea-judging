# Incorrect order when setting top pool's weight will cause the `LUM` rewards to mint more than expected

## Summary
Incorrect order when setting top pool's weight will cause the `LUM` rewards to mint more than expected.

## Vulnerability Detail
From the code comments for `Voter#setTopPoolIdsWithWeights`

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/42e799446595c542eff9519353d3becc50cdba63/magicsea-staking/src/Voter.sol#L250-L259

```solidity
    /**
     * @dev Set farm pools with their weight;
     *
     * WARNING:
     * Caller is responsible to updateAll oldPids on masterChef before using this function
     * and also call updateAll for the new pids after.
     *
     * @param pids - list of pids
     * @param weights - list of weights
     */
```

the order when setting top pool's weight is
1. `MasterChef#updateAll(oldPids)`
2. `Voter#setTopPoolIdsWithWeights(newPids)`
3. `MasterChef#updateAll(newPids)`

This order is also used in `js/sync-farm.js` and confirmed by the sponsor in a private thread.

Before (3), the `newPids`'s `rewarder.lastUpdateTimestamp` is less than `block.timestamp`. By calling (3) the `LUM` rewards will be minted for `newPids` from `rewarder.lastUpdateTimestamp` to current `block.timestamp`, which cause the `LUM` rewards to mint more than expected.

## Impact

Setting top pool's weight will cause `LUM` rewards minting more than expected.

## Recommendation

Document the correct order to set top pool's weight
1. `MasterChef#updateAll(oldPids)`
2. `MasterChef#updateAll(newPids)`
3. `Voter#setTopPoolIdsWithWeights(newPids)`
