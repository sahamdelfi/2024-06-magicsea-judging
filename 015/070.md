# New top pool weights apply to the time before it has been set.

## Summary
The top pool weights are used to calculate the farm rewards using accrued debt per share of pools.
`Voter.sol#setTopPoolIdsWithWeights` update the top pool weights but doesn't update the accrued debt per share of pools.
Therefore the newly set pool weights may apply to the time before it has been set.

## Vulnerability Detail
Scenario:
1. There are only two pools: `pool1` with weight `20%` and `pool2` with weight `80%` respectively.
2. There are no activities changing the accrued debt per share of pools for some time for instance 1 hour.
3. After that, the owner set the pools weight again: `pool1` with `80%` and `pool2` with `20%`.
4. However the rewards of master chef are distributed to the pools for the very 1 hour such that `80%` for `pool1` and `20%` for `pool2`.

## Impact
New top pool weights apply to the time before it has been set.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Modify the `Voter.sol#setTopPoolIdsWithWeights` as follows.
```diff
    function setTopPoolIdsWithWeights(uint256[] calldata pids, uint256[] calldata weights) external {
        if (msg.sender != _operator) _checkOwner();

        uint256 length = pids.length;
        if (length != weights.length) revert IVoter__InvalidLength();

        uint256[] memory oldIds = _topPids.values();

+       _masterChef.updateAll(oldIds);

        ......
    }
```
