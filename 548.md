# The approver of a staking position cannot vote for the position owner.

## Summary
The approver of a staking position cannot vote for the position owner, thus position owner cannot delegate their voting power to another user or protocol, impacting the integration with other protocols.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `Voter.vote` function, the caller is limited to the owner of the position `tokenId`. However, the position owner can approve another user or protocol (i.e., approver) to use his token, so the approver should have the right to vote on behalf of the owner. However, the `Voter.vote` function does not allow this. This breaking the core functionality of the `Voter` contract.

```solidity
// Function: Voter.sol#vote

160:        // check ownership of tokenId
161:@>      if (_mlumStaking.ownerOf(tokenId) != msg.sender) {
162:            revert IVoter__NotOwner();
163:        }
```

## Impact
Position owner cannot delegate their voting power to another user or protocol, breaking the core functionality of the `Voter` contract, and impacting the integration with other protocols.

## Recommendation
Allow the position approver to vote for the position owner. 
```solidity
-       if (_mlumStaking.ownerOf(tokenId) != msg.sender) {
+       if (_mlumStaking.ownerOf(tokenId) != msg.sender && _mlumStaking.getApproved(tokenId) != msg.sender) { 
```
