# Use of `ReentrancyGuard` Instead of `ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable` in MlumStaking Contract

## Summary
The contract imports and uses ReentrancyGuard from the non-upgradeable OpenZeppelin library. However, since the contract is intended to be upgradeable, it should import and use ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable from the OpenZeppelin upgradeable library to ensure proper functionality and security in an upgradeable context.

## Vulnerability Detail
The current implementation imports ReentrancyGuard from openzeppelin/utils/ReentrancyGuard.sol, which is designed for non-upgradeable contracts. Using this in an upgradeable contract can lead to potential issues because the reentrancy guard logic may not function correctly when the contract is upgraded. Specifically, reentrancy protection might fail after an upgrade, exposing the contract to reentrancy attacks.

## Impact
The primary impact of this vulnerability is the potential exposure of the contract to reentrancy attacks, which could lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of contract state and funds. This can compromise the integrity and security of the contract, leading to potential loss of assets and other critical data.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
import {ReentrancyGuard} from "openzeppelin/utils/ReentrancyGuard.sol";
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
use ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable 
```solidity
import {ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable} from "openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/utils/ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable.sol";
```
Ensure the initializer includes the reentrancy guard initialization:

```solidity
function initialize() initializer public {
     __Ownable2Step_init();
     __ERC721Enumerable_init();
 +   __ReentrancyGuard_init();
}
```
