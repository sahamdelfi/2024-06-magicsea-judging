# Owner can't create new farms because of a wrong check in MasterChefV2::add()

## Summary
New farm can't be created because of a wrong check in MasterChefV2::add().
## Vulnerability Detail
Let's take a look at the Voter::createFarms function:
```solidity
    function createFarms(address[] calldata pools) external onlyOwner {
        uint256 farmLengths = _masterChef.getNumberOfFarms();
        uint256 minimumVotes = _minimumVotesPerPool;
        
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < pools.length; ++i) {
            if (_votes.get(pools[i]) >= minimumVotes && !hasFarm(pools[i], farmLengths)) {
                //add the farm to the masterchef
                _masterChef.add(IERC20(pools[i]), IMasterChefRewarder(address(0)));
            }
        }
    }
```
The function calls MasterChefV2::add():
```solidity
    function add(IERC20 token, IMasterChefRewarder extraRewarder) external override {

        if (msg.sender != address(_lbHooksManager)) _checkOwnerOrOperator(); <--

        uint256 pid = _farms.length;

        Farm storage farm = _farms.push();

        farm.token = token;
        farm.rewarder.lastUpdateTimestamp = block.timestamp;

        if (address(extraRewarder) != address(0)) _setExtraRewarder(pid, extraRewarder);

        token.balanceOf(address(this)); // sanity check

        emit FarmAdded(pid, token);
    }
```
msg.sender here is the Voter contract and the check on the 1st line checks if msg.sender is the `_lbHooksManager`, and if it's not, it checks if it's the owner or the operator.

Now, Voter is obviously not `_lbHooksManager` because in the constructor they are declared as different parameters:
```solidity
    constructor(
        ILum lum,
        IVoter voter,
        IRewarderFactory rewarderFactory,
        address lbHooksManager,
        uint256 treasuryShare
    ) {
```
and is obviously not operator since there's only 1 operator and if the Voter is operator he wouldn't be able to call the functions that are callable only the operator since such functionality doesn't exist in the Voter contract. 
## Impact
Farms can't be created.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Remove that check or allow the Voter to be able to call that function as well.
