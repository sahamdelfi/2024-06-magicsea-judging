# `Voter.createFarms()` may fail from lack of access privilege

## Summary
If `Voter` isn't the `_lbHooksManager`, `_operator` or `owner()` of `MasterchefV2`, `createFarms()` will revert.

## Vulnerability Detail
`Voter.createFarms()` calls `MasterchefV2.add()`, which checks that the caller is either  `_lbHooksManager`, `_operator` or `owner()` of `MasterchefV2`. Hence, if `Voter` is not set to any of these roles **(which seems to be the case from the upgrade script)**, the call will revert.

To be clear, this issue is NOT about forgetting to give `Voter` access, but about availability: its requirement to be set as either 1 of the 3 roles specified, which could necessarily be taken up by either contracts / EOAs.

## Impact
Loss of functionality.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Allow `add()` to be called by `_voter`.
