# Due to an incorrect check in `add()` of `MasterchefV2.sol`, `createFarms()` of `Voter.sol` is always reverted.

## Summary
Due to an incorrect check in `add()` of `MasterchefV2.sol`, `createFarms()` of `Voter.sol` is always reverted.
Therefore, the core function of the protocol is destroyed.

## Vulnerability Detail
The protocol maximizes users' profits by adding `farms` using `createFarms()` of `Voter.sol`. 
However, due to incorrect code implementation, the function is always reverted.
`createFarms()` of `Voter.sol` is as following.
```solidity
    function createFarms(address[] calldata pools) external onlyOwner {
        uint256 farmLengths = _masterChef.getNumberOfFarms();
        uint256 minimumVotes = _minimumVotesPerPool;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < pools.length; ++i) {
            if (_votes.get(pools[i]) >= minimumVotes && !hasFarm(pools[i], farmLengths)) {
236:            _masterChef.add(IERC20(pools[i]), IMasterChefRewarder(address(0)));
            }
        }
    }
```
As you can see above, only the manager can call `createFarms()`, and `createFarms()` calls `add()` of `MasterchefV2.sol`.
The `add()` of `MasterchefV2.sol` is as following.
```solidity
    function add(IERC20 token, IMasterChefRewarder extraRewarder) external override {
        if (msg.sender != address(_lbHooksManager)) _checkOwnerOrOperator();

        //_checkOwner(); // || msg.sender != address(_voter)

        uint256 pid = _farms.length;

        Farm storage farm = _farms.push();

        farm.token = token;
        farm.rewarder.lastUpdateTimestamp = block.timestamp;

        if (address(extraRewarder) != address(0)) _setExtraRewarder(pid, extraRewarder);

        token.balanceOf(address(this)); // sanity check

        emit FarmAdded(pid, token);
    }
```
As you can see above, only `_lbHooksManager`, `Operator` and `Owner` can call this function. 
Here according to protocol team, roles of `_lbHooksManager` and `Operator` are as following.
>Voter is the contract holding the voting logic. Lb hooks manager is not in the repo but will be a contract creating hooks for liquidity pairs and is part of the concentrated liquidity rewarding. 
It will later emit lum so he need rights for adding farms on masterchef. But it's not part of the repo
>Operator is a trusted wallet for keeper actions. the idea is that after the voting period a keeper adds missing farms for pools which had votes

This shows that `Voter.sol` cannot call `add()`.

## Impact
Due to an incorrect check in `add()` of `MasterchefV2.sol`, `createFarms()` of `Voter.sol` is always reverted.
Therefore, the core function of the protocol is destroyed.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The `add()` in `MasterchefV2.sol` is modified as follows.
```solidity
    function add(IERC20 token, IMasterChefRewarder extraRewarder) external override {
---     if (msg.sender != address(_lbHooksManager)) _checkOwnerOrOperator();
+++     if (sg.sender != address(_lbHooksManager) || msg.sender != address(voter)) _checkOwnerOrOperator();

        //_checkOwner(); // || msg.sender != address(_voter)

        uint256 pid = _farms.length;

        Farm storage farm = _farms.push();

        farm.token = token;
        farm.rewarder.lastUpdateTimestamp = block.timestamp;

        if (address(extraRewarder) != address(0)) _setExtraRewarder(pid, extraRewarder);

        token.balanceOf(address(this)); // sanity check

        emit FarmAdded(pid, token);
    }
```
