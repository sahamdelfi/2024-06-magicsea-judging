# Voter can't create farming pool on MasterChef contract

## Summary
Voter contract can't create farming pool on MasterChef contract after a successful voting period.
## Vulnerability Detail
Due to missing permission on .add() function at MasterChef contract, voter can't call it successfully
## Impact
It's impossible to create new farming pools which is selected by the voters.
## Code Snippet with Proof of Concept
Calling add() function is impossible by voter due to this implementation logic. Permission is basicly not given

```solidity
    function add(IERC20 token, IMasterChefRewarder extraRewarder) external override {
        if (msg.sender != address(_lbHooksManager)) _checkOwnerOrOperator();
```
Voter defined as _voter:
```solidity
constructor(
        ILum lum,
        IVoter voter,
        IRewarderFactory rewarderFactory,
        address lbHooksManager,
        uint256 treasuryShare
    ) {
        _disableInitializers();

        if (treasuryShare > Constants.PRECISION) revert MasterChef__InvalidShares();

        _lum = lum;
        _voter = voter;
        _rewarderFactory = rewarderFactory;
        _lbHooksManager = lbHooksManager;

        _treasuryShare = treasuryShare;
    }
```
Check operator or owner defined as:
```solidity
    function _checkOwnerOrOperator() private view {
        if (msg.sender != address(_operator)) _checkOwner();
    }
```
Lastly, check owner defined as:
```solidity
    function _checkOwner() internal view virtual {
        if (owner() != _msgSender()) {
            revert OwnableUnauthorizedAccount(_msgSender());
        }
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Adding _voter to permitted addresses solves the problem:

```console
@@ -365,7 +372,7 @@ contract MasterChef is Ownable2StepUpgradeable, IMasterChef {
      * @param extraRewarder The extra rewarder of the farm.
      */
     function add(IERC20 token, IMasterChefRewarder extraRewarder) external override {
-        if (msg.sender != address(_lbHooksManager)) _checkOwnerOrOperator();
+        if (msg.sender != address(_lbHooksManager) && msg.sender != address(_voter)) _checkOwnerOrOperator();
```
