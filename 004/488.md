# MasterchefV2::add cannot be called from Voter breaking the farm creation

## Summary

Due to missing access control, new farm creation will not work, breaking the team's intentions to have a voting system for them.

## Vulnerability Detail

In order for a farm to be created from the `Voter` contract admin, 2 requirements should be fulfilled:

- no existing farm with that lpToken
- has passed the minimum vote threshold

Then `Voter::createFarm` is called and new farms for the given pool will be created, allowing lpToken holders to deposit to them. The problem is in `MasterchefV2::add`:

```solidity
/**
   * @dev Adds a farm.
   * @param token The token of the farm.
   * @param extraRewarder The extra rewarder of the farm.
   */
  function add(IERC20 token, IMasterChefRewarder extraRewarder) external override {
      if (msg.sender != address(_lbHooksManager)) _checkOwnerOrOperator();

      //_checkOwner(); // || msg.sender != address(_voter)

      uint256 pid = _farms.length;

      Farm storage farm = _farms.push();

      farm.token = token;
      farm.rewarder.lastUpdateTimestamp = block.timestamp;

      if (address(extraRewarder) != address(0)) _setExtraRewarder(pid, extraRewarder);

      token.balanceOf(address(this)); // sanity check

      emit FarmAdded(pid, token);
  }
```

As we can see there are access control checks, allowing only `_lbHooksManager`, `owner` and `operator` to call this function, but not the `Voter` contract, reverting all the calls.

If we take a look at the deployment script file `1_Upgrade_MasterChef.s.sol` (not in scope, but give example how the configuration will look like), we will see that farm addition happens directly, not through the `Voter` contract, which deviates from the intended design.

```solidity
contract AddFarm is Script {
  function run() public {
      uint256 pk = vm.envUint("PRIVATE_KEY");
      address deployer = vm.addr(pk);

      console.log("Deployer --> ", deployer);
      MasterChef masterChef = MasterChef(Addresses.PROXY_MASTERCHEF_TESTNET);

      IERC20 lpToken = IERC20(0x8d7bD0dA2F2172027C1FeFc335a1594238C76A20); // lum-usdc

      vm.broadcast(pk);
      masterChef.add(lpToken, IMasterChefRewarder(address(0)));
  }
}
```

## Impact

Inability new farms to be created, due to missing allowance `Voter` to call `add` function in the `MasterchefV2`.

## Recommendation

Uncomment this check and add it to the if statement above: `//_checkOwner(); // || msg.sender != address(_voter)`
