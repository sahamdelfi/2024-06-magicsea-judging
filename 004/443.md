# DoS of `Voter::createFarms` due to incorrect access control in `MasterchefV2::add`

## Summary
`Voter::add` has an [external call](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/Voter.sol#L236) to the `MasterchefV2::add` function to add a farm. However, the access controll of the `add` function does not allow this function to be called by anyone other than _lbHooksManager, owner, operator. That is, the call from _voter will not pass.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the `MasterchefV2` contract, there is a storage variable _voter that stores the address of _voter, that is _voter != _lbHooksManager. Also in the Masterchef deploy script, the address of _lbHooksManager is [hardcode value](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/script/config/Addresses.sol#L34)
## Impact
Permanent DoS of the contract owner's functionality

Severity: Medium
## Code Snippet
```solidity
function add(IERC20 token, IMasterChefRewarder extraRewarder) external override {
        if (msg.sender != address(_lbHooksManager)) _checkOwnerOrOperator();
.....
```
