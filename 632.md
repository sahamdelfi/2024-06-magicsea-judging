# INCONSISTENT DATA LOCATION IN remainingLockTime() function in MLumStaking.sol contract MAY LEAD TO DISCREPANCIES

## Summary
In `addToPosition` function of the MlumStaking.sol contract, there's a call to `_remainingLockTime` function. Now, this function calculates the remaining lock duration of a position. There seems to be an inconsistent data location of the parameter argument that's passed into the `_remainingLockTime` function

## Vulnerability Detail
1. The remainingLockTime function itself takes a function argument, StakingPosition struct,  that's cached in memory. #See Below

2. However, in `addToPosition` function, the argument that's passed into the `remainingLockTime` function call is cached in storage data location.

  + See that the position argument that's passed into the `remainingLockTime` is cached in storage. # See Below

## Impact
Such inconsistencies in data location may give rise to discrepancies in the accounting of remaining lock duration within this said function.

## Recommendation
Change the parameter argument of the `remainingLockTime()` function from **StakingPosition memory position** to **StakingPosition storage position** so as to match the call in `addToPosition`.
