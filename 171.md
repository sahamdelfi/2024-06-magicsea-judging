# Rounding to zero while calculating `debtPerShare` in `MasterChefRewarder`, `BribeRwarder` when the rewards is low decimals token will prevent the rewards from accruing as an attacker will update the rewards every block

## Summary

Rounding to zero while calculating `debtPerShare` in `MasterChefRewarder`, `BribeRwarder` when the rewards is low decimals token will prevent the rewards from accruing as an attacker will update the rewards every block

## Vulnerability Detail

When the function `MasterChef#claim` is called, `MasterChef` makes a call to `MasterChefRewarder` to calculate the accrued extra rewards from `_rewarder.lastUpdateTimestamp` to the current `block.timestamp`

then the `totalRewards` is used to update `_rewarder.debtPerShare`

The calculation for `_rewarder.debtPerShare`

```solidity
    function getDebtPerShare(uint256 totalDeposit, uint256 totalRewards) internal pure returns (uint256) {
        return totalDeposit == 0 ? 0 : (totalRewards << Constants.ACC_PRECISION_BITS) / totalDeposit;
    }
```

From this calculation, `debtPerShare` will be rounded down to zero when `(totalRewards << Constants.ACC_PRECISION_BITS) < totalDeposit`. The rounding down to zero will be possible when the reward token is a low decimals token.

When the constraint `(totalRewards << Constants.ACC_PRECISION_BITS) < totalDeposit` is met, the attacker can updated the the rewards every block by calling `MasterChef#claim` to prevent the rewards from accruing.

Same idea can be applied to cause the attack for bribe rewards in `BribeRewarder`. But in `BribeRewarder`, the rewards for current voting period is only updated when the function `BribeRewarder#deposit` is called (note that the function `BribeRewarder#claim` does not update the rewards for current voting period). So to cause the attack in `BribeRewarder`, the attacker has to create a `lsNFT` position with `amount = 1` in `MlumStaking`, and use it to vote in `Voter#vote`, then `BribeRewarder#deposit` is called. Although the attack required locking `MLUM`, the attack is still possible and cheap.

## PoC

In `MasterChefRewarder`, assuming:
- The voting duration is `1209600` (14 days) 
- The extra reward token is `USDC` (6 decimals)
- The total extra rewards for this period is `1_209_6e5`, meaning `rewardPerSecond` is `1e3`
- Block time is 10 seconds

The `totalRewards` by updating the rewards every block is `Block Time * emissionsPerSecond = 10 * 1e3 = 1e4`. The `(totalRewards << Constants.ACC_PRECISION_BITS) / totalDeposit` will rounded to zero when `totalDeposit > 184_467e18`. 

The `totalDeposit` is required for this attack to be possible is reasonable for any ERC20 tokens.

In `BribeRewarder`, `totalDeposit` is in `MLUM`, and `MLUM` has a total supply of `1_000_000e18` tokens, the constraint `totalDeposit > 184_467e18` is still reasonable.

## Impact

When the constraint `(totalRewards << Constants.ACC_PRECISION_BITS) < totalDeposit` is met, the attacker can updated the the rewards every block to prevent the rewards from accruing in `MasterChefRewarder`, `BribeRwarder`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

- Convert `totalRewards` to `wad`, at `BaseRewarder.sol:293`
- Convert `totalRewards` to `wad`, at `BribeRewarder.sol:280`
- Convert the rewards back to the original decimal when sending to users.
