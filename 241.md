# Improper Slippage Settings in FarmZapper Contract Exposes Users to Sandwich Attacks

## Summary
A vulnerability was found in the FarmZapper contract, specifically in the _swapAndStake function at lines 249-250. The issue involves improper setting of slippage parameters during the addition of liquidity to the Uniswap pool, exposing users to a sandwich attack risk.

## Vulnerability Detail
The _swapAndStake function incorrectly sets the amountAMin and amountBMin parameters to 1 when calling the addLiquidity function on the MagicSea router. These parameters should represent the minimum amounts of tokens A and B required to add liquidity, ensuring a valid slippage. By setting these values to 1, the contract fails to protect users from slippage, thereby exposing them to potential sandwich attacks.

## Impact
Users who call the swapAndStake function are vulnerable to sandwich attacks due to the improper slippage settings. This can lead to significant financial losses as malicious actors can exploit the low minimum amounts to manipulate the token prices and liquidity.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
(,, uint256 amountLiquidity) = _router.addLiquidity(
    path[0],
    path[1],
    fullInvestment - (swapedAmounts[0]),
    swapedAmounts[1],
    1, // Incorrectly set amountAMin
    1, // Incorrectly set amountBMin
    address(this),
    block.timestamp
);
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Update the amountAMin and amountBMin parameters in the _swapAndStake function to reflect appropriate minimum values. This will ensure valid slippage settings and protect users from sandwich attacks. For example:
```solidity
(,, uint256 amountLiquidity) = _router.addLiquidity(
    path[0],
    path[1],
    fullInvestment - (swapedAmounts[0]),
    swapedAmounts[1],
    minAmountA, // Correctly set minimum amountA
    minAmountB, // Correctly set minimum amountB
    address(this),
    block.timestamp
);
```
