# `_unlockOperators` can manipulate votes

## Summary
In the MlumStaking.sol unlock operators have the right to unlock a position anytime. This gives them the right to create serious manipulation of the vote.
## Vulnerability Detail
The vote function only checks if the vote duration for the current position and the initial lock duration are over the minimum to vote. However this is not enough as unlock operators can create multiple positions vote and than withdraw.
Consider the following scenario:
1. Vote has started. An unlock operator creates a position and votes.
2. Then they withdraw and create position again and vote again.
## Impact
_unlockOperators will cause huge vote manipulation and also cut other user's rewards - High

## Recommendation
Do not allow positions that were just created to vote. Create a delay so that they can vote starting next voting period.
