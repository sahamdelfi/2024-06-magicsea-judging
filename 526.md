# Precision Loss in `_getRewardForPid` Leads to Partial Loss of Rewards

## Vulnerability Detail
MasterChefV2 mints new LUM tokens to reward pools based on _lumPerSecond and distribute it between different pools, reward for each pool is calculated by the following formula: `totalWeight == 0 ? 0 : totalRewards * _voter.getWeight(pid) / totalWeight;`, precision loss is possible in this line of code if totalRewards is very small or pool has a small weight, totalRewaeds is calculated as follow, it depends on time passed from lastUpdateTimestamp of pool rewarder: 
```solidity 
 function getTotalRewards(
        Parameter storage rewarder,
        uint256 rewardPerSecond,
        uint256 endTimestamp,
        uint256 totalSupply
    ) internal view returns (uint256) {
        if (totalSupply == 0) return 0;

        uint256 lastUpdateTimestamp = rewarder.lastUpdateTimestamp;
        uint256 timestamp = block.timestamp > endTimestamp ? endTimestamp : block.timestamp;

        return timestamp > lastUpdateTimestamp ? (timestamp - lastUpdateTimestamp) * rewardPerSecond : 0;
    }
```
so if lastUpdateTimestamp is updated recently it might leads to precision loss and partial loss of rewards

For example lastUpdateTimestamp is 10 ,block.timestamp is 12, pool weight is 10 ,total weight is 300 and _lumPerSecond is 10 so in this case calculated rewards for this period would be 0.666 which can't be applied due to precision loss, lastUpdateTimestamp  is updated and rewards for this duration would be lost. probability of this issue depends on _lumPerSecond, time passed since lastUpdateTimestamp, pool weight and total weight but if users interact with protocol constantly or pool weight is low, it might leads to partial loss of rewards.

## Recommendation
set _lumPerSecond for each unit of pool weight separately instead of all pools
