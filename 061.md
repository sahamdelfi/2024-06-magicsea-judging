# Inconsistent Reward Calculation in getPendingRewards Function

## Summary

The [getPendingRewards function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/MasterchefV2.sol#L190) in the [MasterChefV2 contract](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/MasterchefV2.sol) calculates pending rewards for a given account across multiple farms.

However, it may return inconsistent results if the total supply or user balances are updated during the calculation period. This inconsistency can lead to confusion among users and potential claims of unfair reward distribution. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The `getPendingRewards` function calculates pending rewards based on the current state of user `balances` and `total supply`. If these values are updated during the calculation, the results can be inconsistent. This is particularly problematic in a multi-user environment where staking and unstaking operations frequently change these values.

An ideal situation can be outlined as below: 
1. Multiple users are staking in different pools, each with varying amounts.
2. User A stakes a large amount of tokens, increasing the total supply.
3. Shortly after, User B calls getPendingRewards.
4. User A unstakes their tokens, decreasing the total supply.
5. The rewards calculated for User B are based on fluctuating total supply values, leading to inconsistent and potentially unfair reward calculations.

## Impact

- Users may receive reward calculations that fluctuate based on the timing of other users' staking and unstaking actions.
- Inconsistent rewards can lead to confusion and mistrust among users, who may feel that the reward distribution is unfair or incorrect.
- Savvy users may time their interactions to exploit these inconsistencies for their benefit, further exacerbating the issue.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function getPendingRewards(address account, uint256[] calldata pids)
    external
    view
    override
    returns (uint256[] memory lumRewards, IERC20[] memory extraTokens, uint256[] memory extraRewards)
{
    lumRewards = new uint256[](pids.length);
    extraTokens = new IERC20[](pids.length);
    extraRewards = new uint256[](pids.length);

    for (uint256 i; i < pids.length; ++i) {
        uint256 pid = pids[i];

        Farm storage farm = _farms[pid];

        Rewarder.Parameter storage rewarder = farm.rewarder;
        Amounts.Parameter storage amounts = farm.amounts;

        uint256 balance = amounts.getAmountOf(account);
        uint256 totalSupply = amounts.getTotalAmount();

        {
            (, uint256 lumRewardForPid) = _calculateAmounts(_getRewardForPid(rewarder, pid, totalSupply));
            lumRewards[i] = rewarder.getPendingReward(account, balance, totalSupply, lumRewardForPid)
                + unclaimedRewards[pid][account];
        }

        IMasterChefRewarder extraRewarder = farm.extraRewarder;

        if (address(extraRewarder) != address(0)) {
            (extraTokens[i], extraRewards[i]) = extraRewarder.getPendingReward(account, balance, totalSupply);
        }
    }
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is crucial to ensure consistent calculations of total supply and user balances during reward distribution. This can be achieved by implementing a snapshot mechanism and ensuring atomicity in reward calculation functions.

Use snapshots to record the total supply and user balances at the start of each reward calculation. This ensures that the calculations are based on consistent data.

```solidity
struct Snapshot {
    uint256 totalSupply;
    uint256 balance;
}
mapping(uint256 => mapping(address => Snapshot)) public snapshots;

function takeSnapshot(uint256 pid, address account) internal {
    Farm storage farm = _farms[pid];
    snapshots[pid][account] = Snapshot({
        totalSupply: farm.amounts.getTotalAmount(),
        balance: farm.amounts.getAmountOf(account)
    });
}

function getPendingRewards(address account, uint256[] calldata pids)
   external
   view
   override
   returns (uint256[] memory lumRewards, IERC20[] memory extraTokens, uint256[] memory extraRewards)
{
    lumRewards = new uint256[](pids.length);
    extraTokens = new IERC20[](pids.length);
    extraRewards = new uint256[](pids.length);

    for (uint256 i; i < pids.length; ++i) {
        uint256 pid = pids[i];

        Snapshot memory snapshot = snapshots[pid][account];

        uint256 balance = snapshot.balance;
        uint256 totalSupply = snapshot.totalSupply;

        (, uint256 lumRewardForPid) = _calculateAmounts(_getRewardForPid(farm.rewarder, pid, totalSupply));
        lumRewards[i] = farm.rewarder.getPendingReward(account, balance, totalSupply, lumRewardForPid)
            + unclaimedRewards[pid][account];

        IMasterChefRewarder extraRewarder = farm.extraRewarder;

        if (address(extraRewarder) != address(0)) {
            (extraTokens[i], extraRewards[i]) = extraRewarder.getPendingReward(account, balance, totalSupply);
        }
    }
}
