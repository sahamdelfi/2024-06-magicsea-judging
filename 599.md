# Front-Running the Original Bribe-Rewarders Leads to Issues of not being able to claim Rewards by Voting on their Pools

## Summary

By Front-Running the Original Bribe-Rewarders Leads to Issues of not being able to claim Rewards by Voting on their Pools.  

## Vulnerability Detail

Before understanding this issue in detail, We need to understand how BribeRewarders & Voting Contract works together in-hand, so the flow would be:

<img width="783" alt="Screenshot 2024-07-11 at 6 38 33 PM" src="https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea-gowtham-ponnana/assets/103900755/cb6695af-8a87-4e6a-bd0d-9ce7ddf289f9">

* First, Pool Admin or Anyone can create a new "BribeRewarders or simply called rewarders" for a given pool with the RewardToken of their Choice. 

* Once the rewarder was added to the mapping " _bribesPerPeriod", Users can start voting on their pool with their NFT Id, And later can claim the extra-rewards directly from the "rewarder" - because they've supported the pool in voting.

* In order to claim the tokens, User needs to call the "claim()" function on rewarder contract with their tokenId to receive rewards from the BribeRewarder/rewarder.

[ NOTE ]: As per the CONSTANTS.sol file, we can create a maximum of 5 BribeRewarders/rewarders per pool. 



> Where's the Issue then? 

Let's say the PoolAdmin or legitimate users wanted to be a bribe rewarder of the pool(Example: ETH/USDC) and called the "createBribeRewarder(RewardToken, Pool)" function. 

An attacker watches this transaction on mempool and plans his attack:

-> He'll create a contract which can able to create 5 bribeRewarders in the same Tx with the given values: 
1st Rewarder: (RewardToken: ETH, Pool:ETH/USDC)
2nd Rewarder: (RewardToken: MATIC, Pool:ETH/USDC)
3rd Rewarder: (RewardToken: BNB, Pool:ETH/USDC)
4th Rewarder: (RewardToken: 1inch, Pool:ETH/USDC)
5th Rewarder: (RewardToken: USDC, Pool:ETH/USDC)


-> He creates these BribeRewarders but doesn't fund the contracts with the rewardTokens. [ RewardTokens will be 0 in each rewarder ]

-> Thus, after voting whenever user wants to claim their rewards from the 'BribeRewarders' everything fails as there is no liquidity and it will revert their transaction. 

## Impact

By exploiting this issue, user cannot able to claim the tokens regardless of how many votes they put it and how much they stake in MlumStaking contract. 

Pool gets the votings but users will be at loss.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

I would personally suggest you to recommend don't give user/poolAdmin to create a pool without the minimumAmount of RewardsTokens while initilizing the pool. By making the minimum requirement amount of rewardTokens, you'll stop this attack from happening and also helps the users to claim their tokens.
