# DUE TO FAULTY LOGIC IN updateAll() function, ATTACKER CAN STEAL INFINITE LUM TOKEN REWARDS WHEN HE CALLS claim() and withdraw functions

## Summary
In `MasterChefV2::_updateAll()`, there is an artificial inflation on the value of **rewarder.accDebtPerShare** on every specified Farm PID. The inflation is due to the fact that the value of **rewarder.accDebtPerShare** is left shifted by 64 bits inside the `updateAccDebtPerShare` function of the Rewarder library. In `claim()` function which in turn calls the `_modify`, calculation of rewards associated with a given account is directly proportional to the value of this **rewarder.accDebtPerShare**. And since this **rewarder.accDebtPerShare** has been increased exponentially, user's corresponding rewards would have also increased significantly.
Exploitability path is that attacker must first call updateAll() function, and then call `claim` or `withdraw` afterwards. Attacker must have at least 1 wei of deposit inside that farm's pid.   

## Vulnerability Detail
1. Inside `_updateAll()` is the call to `updateAccDebtPerShare` function on the Rewarder Library, passing in the values of totalSupply (which represents the total Amounts associated with a specific farm) and lumRewardForPid(which represents the liquidity mining amount that was minted to the MasterChef contract when _mintLum function was called). See Below#

2. When we analyse the `updateAccDebtPerShare` function, it is observed that:

   + It first calculates for a certain variable, debtPerShare, by calling `getDebtPerShare(totalSupply, lumRewardForPid)` . Now, this function left shifts the lumRewardForPid value by 64 bits, and divide by the totalSupply (The left shifting per code comments is for precision).
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/libraries/Rewarder.sol#L37-L38

   + Now, it then increase the state variable rewarder.accDebtPerShare by this highly inflated value, and then returns it, ie,
rewarder.accDebtPerShare += 2^64 ( almost 18.5e18)
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/libraries/Rewarder.sol#L161

3.  Now, the vulnerability lies in the fact that, the code fails to right shift the resulting value by the same 64 bits to get the original. It leaves the resulting value as it is which was multiplied by 2^64, effectively an extremely high value. Now, this high value will be the value for rewarder.accDebtPerShare of a farm. 

4. Now, in `MasterChefV2::claim` function, there's a call to the private `_modify` function. See below#
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/MasterchefV2.sol#L316-L319

5.  Now, this `_modify` function calculates lum rewards in the specified PID for the user. It does that by first calling `update` function on the Rewarder Library. 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/MasterchefV2.sol#L549

   + This `update` function calls into `updateAccDebtPerShare` which will further left shift the resulting value by 64 bits, and add it to the rewarder.accDebtPerShare value (due to updateAll(), this value is already inflated by 2^64). 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/libraries/Rewarder.sol#L130-L143

   + The `getDebt()` function is further called which will multiply the rewarder.accDebtPerShare and user's old balance and then unwind the shifted bits by right shifting to 64 bits. 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/libraries/Rewarder.sol#L27-L28

   + The rewardAmount is set to the difference between this highly inflated value and **rewarder.debt[msg.sender]**, and returned to the `_modify` function as lumReward 

6. Now, this highly inflated value returned as lumReward is what is sent to the user via safeTransfer in the` _modify` function.

## Impact
With each farm pid, attacker can steal a considerable sum of lum tokens just with 1 wei deposit into that farm's pid. He can loop through all available farm pools, effectively stealing all lum tokens in the pool. Attacker can steal all lum tokens in the MasterChefV2 contract.

## Recommendation

I donot think there's any need for precision when  `updateAll()` is called. Unwind the precision by right shifting back to 64 bits
