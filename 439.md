# Missing check for fee-on-transfer

## Summary
In the documentation, it is mentioned that `Any type of ERC20 token. Pools are permissionless. So users can open pools even with weird tokens.` Some tokens take a transfer fee `(e.g. STA, PAXG)`, some do not currently charge a fee but may do so in the future `(e.g. USDT, USDC)`. Example: [TransferFee.sol](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20/blob/main/src/TransferFee.sol). This introduces a risk related to `fee-on-transfer` tokens.
## Vulnerability Detail
The functions in the smart contract does not account for tokens that charge a fee on transfer. Fee-on-transfer tokens deduct a percentage of the transfer amount as a fee, resulting in the recipient receiving fewer tokens than expected. This discrepancy can lead to the contract not having sufficient funds to perform its intended operations, such as distributing rewards or bribes.
## Impact
Insufficient Funds in the Contract: If a fee-on-transfer token is used, the actual amount received by the contract will be less than the calculated amount. This can result in the contract being unable to distribute the correct amount of rewards, leading to failed transactions and unsatisfied users.

## Tool used
## Recommendation
To handle fee-on-transfer tokens, modify the functions to check the actual balance before and after the transfer.
