# `MlumStaking` not compatible with tokens with high value of decimals

## Summary

The `MlumStaking` contract has a limitation where the reward token must have fewer than 30 decimals, preventing the use of certain tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `MlumStaking` contract allows users to stake a stake token and, in exchange, receive a reward token. However, the issue is that the reward token must have fewer than 30 decimals, otherwise, it cannot be used.

The severity of this issue is marked as medium due to the following conditions:

- The contest rules explicitly specify the support of "weird" tokens.
- IOTA EVM contains tokens that have 30 decimals https://explorer.evm.iota.org/token/0x656D62DeAF8D482b5890E829a5c4Bb1b101aeD4A?tab=token_transfers

## Impact

It is not possible to use a reward token with decimals `30` and more in `MlumStaking` contract and according to contest documentation the protocol should support weird tokens, including those with high number of decimals.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to set the value of `PRECISION` to `1` for tokens with decimals equal to 30 or more.
