# Some users are unable to withdraw or harvest rewards if the recipient is a contract.

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
The issue lies within the ``harvestPositionTo() ``and ``harvestPositionsTo() ``functions, which are used to harvest rewards from a staking position. The problem arises from the use of ``safeTransfer() ``in Solidity, which internally uses`` transfer()``.

Here is the relevant code snippet:
```solidity

function safeTransfer(IERC20 token, address to, uint256 value) internal {
    _callOptionalReturn(token, abi.encodeCall(token.transfer, (to, value)));
}
```

According to the Solidity documentation, transfer() only forwards 2300 gas. This limitation means that if the recipient is a contract with a receive() or fallback() function that consumes more than 2300 gas, the transaction will revert.

``Additionally, when creating a position, the user receives an LsNFT, which is transferable. If the user transfers to a contract requiring more than 2300 gas, they will be unable to perform any functions. In such a case, the user will need to transfer the position back to an externally owned account (EOA).``
