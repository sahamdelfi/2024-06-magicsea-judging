# If `_safeTransferTo` fails, the reward is lost.

## Summary
If `_safeTransferTo` fails, the reward is lost.

    unclaimedRewards[periodId][tokenId] = 0;
    ...
    _safeTransferTo(token, msg.sender, rewardAmount);


## Vulnerability Detail

The line above performs a forced initialization to 0 without checking the status of `_safeTransferTo` in the future, and does not leave an Event Log for it.

## Impact

If an error occurs in `_safeTransferTo` for various reasons, the user has not received the reward, but all tokens are lost, and confirmation is impossible because there is no Event.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/rewarders/BribeRewarder.sol#L290

        if (isPayOutReward) {
            rewardAmount = rewardAmount + unclaimedRewards[periodId][tokenId];
        @>>>    unclaimedRewards[periodId][tokenId] = 0;
            if (rewardAmount > 0) {
                IERC20 token = _token();
        @>>>        _safeTransferTo(token, msg.sender, rewardAmount);
            }
        } else {
            unclaimedRewards[periodId][tokenId] += rewardAmount;
        }

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is necessary to add an event for success/failure or revert processing in case of failure.
