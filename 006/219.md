# starting new voting period not check current period has already ended

## Summary
starting new voting period not check current period has already ended , which can lead to calculation error result in reward token lost.

## Vulnerability Detail
code [link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/Voter.sol#L107-L115)
```solidity
  function startNewVotingPeriod() public onlyOwner {
      _currentVotingPeriodId++;

      VotingPeriod storage period = _startTimes[_currentVotingPeriodId];
      period.startTime = block.timestamp;
      period.endTime = block.timestamp + _periodDuration;//@audit staring new Period not ensure current has end.

      emit VotingPeriodStarted();
  }
```
From above code we can see there is no check if current period has ended.

when user vote,   user -> Voter.sol ->BribeReward.sol  to calculate the amount of reward token.

[calculation code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/rewarders/BribeRewarder.sol#L300-L313)
```solidiity
    function _calculateRewards(uint256 periodId) internal view returns (uint256) {
        (uint256 startTime, uint256 endTime) = IVoter(_caller).getPeriodStartEndtime(periodId);

        if (endTime == 0 || startTime > block.timestamp) {
            return 0;
        }

        uint256 duration = endTime - startTime;//@audit startNewRound is ensure current round is end which can lead to reward calculation error.
        uint256 emissionsPerSecond = _amountPerPeriod / duration;

        uint256 lastUpdateTimestamp = _lastUpdateTimestamp;
        uint256 timestamp = block.timestamp > endTime ? endTime : block.timestamp;
        return timestamp > lastUpdateTimestamp ? (timestamp - lastUpdateTimestamp) * emissionsPerSecond : 0;
    }
```

the `_amountPerPeriod` is a fixed value after admin fund `BribeReward.sol` contract. Thus the emissions speed is based on `endTime - startTime` aka period duration. 

If the administrator intentionally or unintentionally starts a new voting period early, it will result in the remaining reward tokens being stuck in the contract because the release rate of reward tokens is calculated based on the end time.


## Impact
reward tokens being stuck in the contract
