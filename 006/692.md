# Vote can be started in the middle of a previous vote

## Summary
Votes epoch can be changed in the middle of a vote

## Vulnerability Detail

As seen in the code https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/Voter.sol#L107-L114 , there is no check if there is an active voting period before setting new voting period, this could lead to new voters intending to vote in a current epoch transferred to another epoch

## Impact
Accounting issues on votes weights and counts and unfair advantage to user who voted in the last epoch

this can also lead to sandwiching of the `startNewVotingPeriod` to gain unfair advantage like this flow
Stake -> Vote -> startNewVotingPeriod -> Vote -> Withdraw

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/Voter.sol#L107-L114

```solidity
function startNewVotingPeriod() public onlyOwner {
        _currentVotingPeriodId++;

        VotingPeriod storage period = _startTimes[_currentVotingPeriodId];
        period.startTime = block.timestamp;
        period.endTime = block.timestamp + _periodDuration;

        emit VotingPeriodStarted();
    }

```
