# The `period.endTime` Can Not Match With Its Assigned Value

## Summary

The `Voter` contract sets the `endTime` for a certain period with a fixed time when starting a voting period. However the end period does not necessarily correspond to that value. This may result in an improper time reward distribution on the `BribeReward` contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

Theoretically the `period` time is `14 days`. However the function `startNewVotingPeriod` can be called at any time. If a period is finished sooner than expected the `endTime` will still be a value on the future. That period is not possible to be voted, but it still goes on.

Moreover the `BribeRewarder` still uses the wrong end time to distribute the rewards although it is impossible to still vote on that period.

## Impact

users may need to wait for times that are not reflected on the current contract to get their rewards.

## Code Snippet

[startNewVotingPeriod function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/Voter.sol#L107-L115)
```solidity
  function startNewVotingPeriod() public onlyOwner {
      _currentVotingPeriodId++;

      VotingPeriod storage period = _startTimes[_currentVotingPeriodId];
      period.startTime = block.timestamp;
      period.endTime = block.timestamp + _periodDuration;

      emit VotingPeriodStarted();
  }
```

## Recommendation

Assign the end time of the previous period when starting a new period.
