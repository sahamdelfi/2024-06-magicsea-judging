# [Medium] Beginning the voting period can be delayed by miners in their interest (use of `block.timestamp` in `Voter::startNewVotingPeriod()` function)

## Summary
The `Voter::startNewVotingPeriod()` function though can only be called by owner, but the function can be delayed arbitrarily by the miners.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `Voter::startNewVotingPeriod()` function updates the starting period with `block.timestamp` to initiate new starting period. This function if postponed by miner, can delay the voting period. Putting a deadline on transaction allows the voting period to be limited by deadline. 

## Impact
This can break functionality as voting can start at arbitrary time as per miner and on-time execution may require owner to provide high amount of funds. But the user funds are not at risk. So medium severity can be assigned.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The owner shall specify the deadline by which the voting period has to start and the function shall revert in case `block.timestamp` is greater than that. 
```diff
-   function startNewVotingPeriod() public onlyOwner {
+   function startNewVotingPeriod(uint256 deadline) public onlyOwner {
        _currentVotingPeriodId++;
+       require(deadline <= block.timestamp, "transaction delayed beyond deadline");
        VotingPeriod storage period = _startTimes[_currentVotingPeriodId];
        period.startTime = block.timestamp;
        period.endTime = block.timestamp + _periodDuration;

        emit VotingPeriodStarted();
    }
```
