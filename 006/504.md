# Voter::startNewVotingPeriod lacks check if the current voting period has ended

## Summary

`Voter::startNewVotingPeriod()` does not check if `_currentVotingPeriodId` has ended.

## Vulnerability Detail

The owner can start new voting periods with `startNewVotingPeriod()`, but the function does not check if the current one has ended, which will make the contract logic inconsistent, as well as `BribeRewarder.sol`'s logic, which is based on the duration of the period.

```solidity
function startNewVotingPeriod() public onlyOwner {
    _currentVotingPeriodId++;

    // AUDIT - no check if last VotingPeriod ended?

    VotingPeriod storage period = _startTimes[_currentVotingPeriodId];
    period.startTime = block.timestamp;
    period.endTime = block.timestamp + _periodDuration;

    emit VotingPeriodStarted();
}
```

## Impact

Period rewards can remain locked as they are based on `_periodDuration`.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add a check that the `timestamp` when calling `startNewVotingPeriod` is after `_currentVotingPeriodId.endTime`.
