# Protocol can pay rewards twice for a small period of time

## Summary

If an voting period is ended sooner than expected by the user, the protocol will lose funds as rewards will be miscalculated.

## Vulnerability Detail

A new period can be started before the current one is ended. As the reward calculation is based on the begin and end time, the protocol will lose a small amount of funds by paying rewards twice
on a small period.

## Impact

Medium. The loss of funds is small.

## Tool used

Foundry coverage.

## Recommendation

Add a requirement about the ending time of the current period on the function startNewVotingPeriod() before creating a new period.
