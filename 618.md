# Users With Special Access Can Able to Drain All Rewards From Rewarders - Using FlashLoans

## Summary

Users with "unlockOperators" permission can able to empty the rewardTokens from the Rewarders by using FlashLoans.

## Vulnerability Detail

Let's assume the scenerio:
-> Pool: ETH/USDC
-> Rewarder1 = RewardToken: MATIC, Pool: ETH/USDC, RewardTokenBalance: 1M
-> Rewarder2 = RewardToken: USDC, Pool: ETH/USDC, RewardTokenBalance: 500K
-> Rewarder3 = RewardToken: BNB, Pool: ETH/USDC, RewardTokenBalance: 1M
-> Rewarder4 = RewardToken: 1Inch, Pool: ETH/USDC, RewardTokenBalance: 50K
-> Rewarder5 = RewardToken: ETH, Pool: ETH/USDC, RewardTokenBalance: 150K

Assuming this is the setup, Whenever users makes a vote on the pool(ETH/USDC), he/she can able to claim rewards subsequently from all the rewarders as per the logic depending upon their DeltaAmount(i.e voting power).   

> Where's the issue my friend? 

[ Let's say Owner gives  the address the "unlockOperators" permission ] - Now, this address owner turns into Attacker.

The issue arises, When an Attacker uses Flash-loans. Here's the attacker PoC:

-> Attacker takes out 50M USDT FlashLoan from Aave.
-> Converts the  50M USDT into MLUM Tokens - To get Voting Power. 
-> Stakes the MLUM Tokens in MlumStaking.sol contract to get Voting Power and NFT. 
-> uses the NFT to Vote on ETH/USDC Pool with the having DeltaPower. 
-> With the given DeltaPower he/she can able to claim the RewardTokens from the given Rewarders(Rewarder1, 2,3,4,5) 
-> Though at first time, the rewardAmount might be low. He'll choose the Major Plan.
-> He goes on to "emergencyWithdraw()" on  MlumStaking.sol to withdraw his tokens back. 
-> Repeats the Steps of Deposting into the StakingContract ---> Getting an NFT --> Voting on the Pool --> Getting the VotingPower --> Claiming the RewarTokens from the rewarders.

He can do it untill he cleans out all the reward Tokens from the all the rewarders and can pay back the FlashLoan fee.
