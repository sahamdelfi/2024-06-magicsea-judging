# Potential Storage Corruption During Contract Upgrade

## Summary

The storage of BaseRewarder could be corrupted during a upgrade.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `MasterChefRewarder` contract is designed to be upgradable, inheriting from `BaseRewarder`. However, `BaseRewarder` does not implement storage gaps, which are crucial for maintaining storage layout compatibility during upgrades. 

Without storage gaps, any new storage variables added to the `BaseRewarder` contract can overwrite existing storage slots, leading to corruption of contract state.

## Impact

The storage of  `BaseRewarder` and `MasterChefRewarder` contracts could be corrupted
