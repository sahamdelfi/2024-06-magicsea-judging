# Contract Upgrade Pattern may be broken in MasterChefRewarder.sol & BaseRewarder.sol

## Summary
Contract Upgrade Pattern may be broken in MasterChefRewarder.sol & BaseRewarder.sol

## Vulnerability Detail
BaseRewarder.sol is meant to be upgradable and it is inherited by MasterChefRewarder.sol
```solidity
contract MasterChefRewarder is BaseRewarder, IMasterChefRewarder {
```
The `base` contract of the project, which contain most of the functionality needed for the proper functioning of the MasterChefRewarder contract, do not `implement` storage gap

Thus, `adding` new storage variables to the inherited contracts can potentially `overwrite` the beginning of the `storage` layout of the child contract, causing `critical` misbehaviors in the system.

## Impact
Lead to a violation of the storage layout during an upgrade, freezing of funds, and unexpected behavior of the contracts.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add storage __gaps 
```solidity
// gap to reserve storage in the contract for future variable additions
uint256[50] __gap;
```
