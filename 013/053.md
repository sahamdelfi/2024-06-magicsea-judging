# Missing storage __gap in BribeRewarder.sol contract

## Summary
Missing storage __gap in BribeRewarder.sol contract

## Vulnerability Detail
BribeRewarder.sol contract is meant to be `upgradeable` but the contract is missing storage `__gap` as it requires for safe-upgrade. [BribeRewarder.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/rewarders/BribeRewarder.sol#L31C27-L31C50)

Without gaps, adding new storage variables to the contract can potentially overwrite the beginning of the storage layout, causing critical misbehaviors in the system.


## Impact
Can't add new storage variable as that will create misbehaviors in the system

## Recommendation
Add storage __gaps in BribeRewarder.sol contract
```solidity
uint256[9] __gap;
```
