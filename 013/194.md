# Corrupted upgradability pattern in `RewarderFactory`, `BribeRewarder` and `BaseRewarder`

## Summary
Missed storage gaps in the `RewarderFactory`, `BribeRewarder` and `BaseRewarder` contracts

## Vulnerability Detail
Absence of upgradable storage
## Impact
The absence of upgradable storage can lead to problems with the upgradability, since if new storage variable is needed, the protocol won't be able to add it, because the storage slots are going to mess up, leading to the  total crash of the system

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add storage gap to the following contacts, like this:
```diff
+   uint256[10] __gap;
```
