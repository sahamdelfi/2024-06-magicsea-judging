# MasterchefV2 _voter will be address(0) due to being initialized in the constructor

## Summary

`MasterchefV2::_voter` will be `address(0)` initially because it is set in the constructor, rather than in the `initialize` functions, as it is a normal variable.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
    IVoter private _voter; // TODO make immutable again
```

`_voter` is not declared as an immutable variable and in upgradeable contracts, which is the `MasterchefV2`, only immutable variables can be assigned from the constructor as they become part of the contract bytecode. As we can see this is not the case here and the default value will be given:

```solidity
constructor(
      ILum lum,
      IVoter voter,
      IRewarderFactory rewarderFactory,
      address lbHooksManager,
      uint256 treasuryShare
  ) {
      _disableInitializers();

      if (treasuryShare > Constants.PRECISION) revert MasterChef__InvalidShares();

      _lum = lum;
      _voter = voter;
      _rewarderFactory = rewarderFactory;
      _lbHooksManager = lbHooksManager;

      _treasuryShare = treasuryShare;
  }
```

## Impact

Voter contract will not be usable without being manually updated from `MasterchefV2`.
