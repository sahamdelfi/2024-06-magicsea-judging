# `MasterChef._voter` is assigned in the constructor, but it is not immutable.

## Summary
`MasterChef._voter` is assigned in the constructor, but it is not immutable.

## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
`_voter = voter;` is in the constructor, but `voter` is not immutable, so it should be set in `initialize` function.
Other functions will read `_voter` in the proxy contract, but it will be `address(0)`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
There are two options.
1. If `_voter` is not immutable, set `_voter` in `initialize` function.
2. Change from `IVoter private _voter;` to `IVoter immutable private _voter;`.
