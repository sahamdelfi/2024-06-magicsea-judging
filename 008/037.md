# The `_voter` is not initiated in `MasterChef`

## Summary

The `_voter` is not  initiated as intended.

## Vulnerability Detail

The state variable `_voter` is intended to be set up by the constructor and used throughout the contract. However, it is not marked as `immutable`, which can render the assignment in the constructor ineffective.

The dev seems forgot to "make immutable again" as the comment stated:
```solidity
IVoter private _voter; // TODO make immutable again
```

## Impact

Uninitiated voter contract.
