# The `voter` address set in the constructor has no impact on the proxy contract

## Summary
 The `voter` address set in the constructor of the implementation instead of the initialize function for the proxy.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `_voter` address is established in the `MasterChefV2` contract's constructor. However, since the `MasterChefV2` contract uses a proxy, the `_voter` address is only set in the Implementation contract and doesn't impact the Proxy.

## Impact
Setting the `_voter` address in the constructor of Implementaion contract does not affect the Proxy contract. In the Proxy, the `_voter` address remains `address(0)`.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/MasterchefV2.sol#L87

```solidity
IVoter private _voter; // TODO make immutable again

// ...

constructor(
    ...
) {
    _disableInitializers();

    if (treasuryShare > Constants.PRECISION) revert MasterChef__InvalidShares();

    _lum = lum;
    _voter = voter; // @audit no effect in proxy contract
    _rewarderFactory = rewarderFactory;
    _lbHooksManager = lbHooksManager;

    _treasuryShare = treasuryShare;
}

// ...

function initialize(address initialOwner, address treasury) external reinitializer(3) {
    __Ownable_init(initialOwner);

    _setTreasury(treasury);

    _mintLUM = false;
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Set the `_voter` address in the `initialize()` function.
