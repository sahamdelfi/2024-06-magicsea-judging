# Variable initialized in constructor can never be used by proxy

## Summary
In the `MasterchefV2` the constructor passes in a `voter` variable, however as seen [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/MasterchefV2.sol#L35), this variable is not `immutable` and has no setter function so it cannot be initialized by the proxy pointing to this contract

## Vulnerability Detail
This variable will always be `address(0)` when used in a `DELEGATECALL` from the proxy pointing to this implementation

## Impact
Any function using this variable will not work properly due to it being un-set

## Code Snippet

The variable:

```solidity
IVoter private _voter
```

The constructor:

```solidity
constructor(
        ILum lum,
        IVoter voter,
        IRewarderFactory rewarderFactory,
        address lbHooksManager,
        uint256 treasuryShare
    ) {
        _disableInitializers();

        if (treasuryShare > Constants.PRECISION) revert MasterChef__InvalidShares();

        _lum = lum;
        _voter = voter;
        _rewarderFactory = rewarderFactory;
        _lbHooksManager = lbHooksManager;

        _treasuryShare = treasuryShare;
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Make `voter` immutable or add it to the initializer
