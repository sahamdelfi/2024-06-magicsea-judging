# Protocol is incompatible with tokens that returns false on transfer

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

OpenZeppelin's ERC20 `safeTransfer` forces that a token, if it returns a boolean on transferring, must return true. 

There are some tokens that [returns false even on successful transfers](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20?tab=readme-ov-file#missing-return-values). Then using `safeTransfer` will always revert, and thus the protocol is incompatible with these tokens.

Some functionalities, such as `MlumStaking.withdrawFromPosition()`, or `Masterchef.withdraw()`, forces a reward harvesting when withdrawing. These functions will fail when the reward is inevitably transferred.

## Impact

Protocol is incompatible with tokens that returns false on transfer

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider handling the transfer separately if the protocol intends to support these tokens. Also consider adding an option to withdraw without harvesting rewards on `Masterchef`.
