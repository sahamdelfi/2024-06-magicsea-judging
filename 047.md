# `setRewardParameters` causes users to lose rewards

## Summary
In the setRewardParameters a new rate is being calculated for the distribution of tokens. However a wrong state change causes users to lose rewards.
## Vulnerability Detail
In `_setRewardParameters` the owner should choose a timestamp in the future for the new rewardRate. However the period between the call made by the owner and the startTimestamp of the new reward distribution rates will result in a loss for users from the previous reward rate.
Consider the following scenario:
1. The owner decides to update the rewardRate from a given start in the future. They call `setRewarderParameters` to change the rewardRate starting next week.
2. `_setRewardParameters` makes the following state change:
```solidity 
 _rewarder.lastUpdateTimestamp = startTimestamp;
```
3. Since the startTimestamp was set in the future the users will lose their rewards from the period from block.timestamp until startTimestamp.
## Impact
Loss of funds for users
