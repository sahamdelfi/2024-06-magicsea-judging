# Absence of deflationary rebasing tokens protection in `BaseRewarder`

## Summary
Absence of deflationary rebasing tokens protection in `BaseRewarder`
## Vulnerability Detail
The `sweep()` function is a good defence agains inflationary rebasing tokens attack, but the absence of such defence for deflationary rebasing tokens, can lead to a state where the protocol is absolutely incompatible with such tokens
## Impact
Users can straight up lose their money, if there is such rebasing token in both the `BaseRewarder` and `BribeRewarder` contracts

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a rebasing token pattern by checking the balance of the toke before and after the transfer
