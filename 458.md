# Medium -  Contract might lose track of token in the Add() in Masterchef.sol

## Label
Other

## Summary
 Without Ensuring that Each token is unique when calling [add()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/MasterchefV2.sol#L367-L384) in the MasterChefV2.sol contract, the contract might lose track of which tokens are added in the farm and this would affect reward distribution because duplicate entries will skew calculations.

## Vulnerability Detail
When calling the MasterchefV2.add() there is no check throughout the function for if a _p_id is already registered_, to revert the call. Hence a p_id already registered can still be added to the farm. And since this is not prevented, it might lead to **incorrect state tracking**.


## Impact
1. The pid mapping is crucial for tracking which tokens are in the farm and their positions.  Without ensuring that each token is unique, the contract might lose track of which tokens are actually in the pool, affecting reward distribution:  Duplicate entries could skew these calculations, leading to unfair distribution of rewards.
2. Any operations that rely on the pid mapping for identifying tokens, such as transferring tokens between pools or adjusting allocation points, could malfunction or behave unpredictably.

## Recommendation
        require(pid[_token] == 0, "already registered"); // pid starts from 0
