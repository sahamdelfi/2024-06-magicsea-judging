# harvestPositionsTo cannot be used as intended

## Summary

`harvestPositionsTo` cannot be used as intended and the **`to`** parameter is redundant due to incorrect check.

## Vulnerability Detail

MlumStaking has harvest function and tries to have 3 implementations.

`MlumStaking` has a `harvest` function and tries to have 3 implementations.

- Harvesting single NFT and passing the owner as recipient
- Harvesting single NFT and passing 3-party recipient
- Harvesting multiple NFTs and passing 3rd-party recipient

But the last one does not work as intended due to an unnecessary check.

```solidity
/**
 * @dev Harvest from multiple staking positions to "to" address
 *
 * Can only be called by lsNFT's owner or approved address
 */
function harvestPositionsTo(uint256[] calldata tokenIds, address to) external override nonReentrant {
    _updatePool();

    uint256 length = tokenIds.length;

    for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; ++i) {
        uint256 tokenId = tokenIds[i];
        _requireOnlyApprovedOrOwnerOf(tokenId);
        address tokenOwner = ERC721Upgradeable.ownerOf(tokenId);
        // if sender is the current owner, must also be the harvest dst address
        // if sender is approved, current owner must be a contract
        require(
            (msg.sender == tokenOwner && msg.sender == to), // legacy || tokenOwner.isContract()
            "FORBIDDEN"
        );

        _harvestPosition(tokenId, to);
        _updateBoostMultiplierInfoAndRewardDebt(_stakingPositions[tokenId]);
    }
}
```

This function is intended to be called by the `tokenOwner` or `approved` users as specified in the NatSpec and pass an arbitrary address **`to`** (who will receive the reward). But now only the owner can call and only the owner can be the recipient because of the `require` check**.**

**`require((msg.sender == tokenOwner && msg.sender == to), "FORBIDDEN");`**

## Impact

`to` address cannot differ from owner and approved users cannot call the function.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Remove the require statement, this will allow approved users to call this and a different `to` address can be passed.
