# A check in `MlumStaking.harvestPositionsTo()`  makes approved users unable to harvest position for tokenId owner

## Summary
A check in `MlumStaking.harvestPositionsTo()`  makes approved users unable to harvest position for tokenId owner

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
    function harvestPositionsTo(uint256[] calldata tokenIds, address to) external override nonReentrant {
        _updatePool();

        uint256 length = tokenIds.length;

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; ++i) {
            uint256 tokenId = tokenIds[i];
            _requireOnlyApprovedOrOwnerOf(tokenId);
            address tokenOwner = ERC721Upgradeable.ownerOf(tokenId);
            // if sender is the current owner, must also be the harvest dst address
            // if sender is approved, current owner must be a contract
            require(
                (msg.sender == tokenOwner && msg.sender == to), // legacy || tokenOwner.isContract()
                "FORBIDDEN"//@audit-issue should have been a condition instead? if statement.  Approved can't call this.. 
            );

            _harvestPosition(tokenId, to);
            _updateBoostMultiplierInfoAndRewardDebt(_stakingPositions[tokenId]);
        }
    }

```

checking `MlumStaking.harvestPositionsTo()`, `_requireOnlyApprovedOrOwnerOf()` is used as access control to allow only tokenId owner and people he approves to call the function for him. 

There's an issue in `MlumStaking.harvestPositionsTo()` function tho that will make approved users unable to harvest position for tokenId owner

This require statement below that enforces that msg.sender is tokenOwner and `to` address.
```solidity
           require(
                (msg.sender == tokenOwner && msg.sender == to), // legacy || tokenOwner.isContract()
                "FORBIDDEN"//@audit-issue should have been a condition instead? if statement.  Approved can't call this.. 
            );
```

i believe this should have been an if statement and not a require statement. Like the check should have been, if msg.sender is == token, ensure he is also `to` address. But using require statement enforces that msg.sender must be tokenId owner therefore making approved users unable to harvest position for tokenId owner.

## Recommendation
use an IF statement to check if msg.sender is == tokenID owner and then enforce that he is also == `to` address
