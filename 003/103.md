# if staker gets blacklisted by stakeAsset their funds will be permanently frozen within MlumStaking.sol contract.

## Summary
`MlumStaking.withdrawFromPosition()` doesn't allow users specify another address to receive funds incase their address gets blacklisted by stakeAsset.

## Vulnerability Detail
Assets like usdc and usdt have blacklisting functionality AND the position withdrawal mechanism(i.e `withdrawFromPosition()` logic) doesn't allow users to specify another address to receive their funds.
```solidity
    function withdrawFromPosition(uint256 tokenId, uint256 amountToWithdraw) external nonReentrant {
        _requireOnlyApprovedOrOwnerOf(tokenId);

        _updatePool();
        address nftOwner = ERC721Upgradeable.ownerOf(tokenId);
        _withdrawFromPosition(nftOwner, tokenId, amountToWithdraw);
    }

    function _withdrawFromPosition(address nftOwner, uint256 tokenId, uint256 amountToWithdraw) internal {
        require(amountToWithdraw > 0, "null");
        // withdrawFromPosition: amount cannot be null

        StakingPosition storage position = _stakingPositions[tokenId];
        require(
            _unlockOperators.contains(nftOwner)
                || (position.startLockTime + position.lockDuration) <= _currentBlockTimestamp() || isUnlocked(),
            "locked"
        );
        // withdrawFromPosition: invalid amount
        require(position.amount >= amountToWithdraw, "invalid");

        _harvestPosition(tokenId, nftOwner);

        // update position 
        position.amount = position.amount - amountToWithdraw;

        // update total lp supply
        _stakedSupply = _stakedSupply - amountToWithdraw;

        if (position.amount == 0) {
            // destroy if now empty
            _stakedSupplyWithMultiplier = _stakedSupplyWithMultiplier - position.amountWithMultiplier;
            _destroyPosition(tokenId);
        } else {
            _updateBoostMultiplierInfoAndRewardDebt(position);
        }

        emit WithdrawFromPosition(tokenId, amountToWithdraw);
        stakedToken.safeTransfer(nftOwner, amountToWithdraw);
    }

```

Since they can't specify another address to receive their funds, their funds will be permanently frozen in MlumStaking.sol contract

## Impact
if staker gets blacklisted by stakeAsset their funds will be permanently frozen within MlumStaking.sol contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
allow users to specify another address to receive their funds. just similar to `harvestPositionTo()` 
```solidity
function harvestPositionTo(uint256 tokenId, address to)
```
give them a `to` param when withdrawing their positions too
