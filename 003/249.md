# Approved address is allowed to call harvestPositionsTo but the call fails due to conflicting checks

## Summary

The `harvestPositionTo()` and `harvestPositionsTo()` functions are intended to be callable by nft owner, or an approved address but any harvestPositionsTo() call by an approved address of a tokenID will always fail.

## Vulnerability Detail

Here is the relevant code :

```solidity

    function harvestPositionsTo(uint256[] calldata tokenIds, address to) external override nonReentrant {
        _updatePool();

        uint256 length = tokenIds.length;

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; ++i) {
            uint256 tokenId = tokenIds[i];
            _requireOnlyApprovedOrOwnerOf(tokenId);
            address tokenOwner = ERC721Upgradeable.ownerOf(tokenId);

            require(
                (msg.sender == tokenOwner && msg.sender == to),
                "FORBIDDEN"
            ); <-- @audit

            _harvestPosition(tokenId, to);
            _updateMultiplierInfoAndRewardDebt(_stakingPositions[tokenId]); // this is only supposed to update rewardDebt here.
        }
    }
```

We can clearly see that it uses `_requireOnlyApprovedOrOwnerOf(tokenId)` to check on the caller, which means it is intended to allow an approved address to call this, which also makes sense because the behavior of `harvestPositionTo()` is similar.

But such a call will always fail due to the conflicting check on the next line :

```solidity
            require(
                (msg.sender == tokenOwner && msg.sender == to),
                "FORBIDDEN"
            )
```

When called by an approved address (which might be an NFT Operator contract set up by the user, or a simple keeper bot employed to just regularly keep collecting rewards from multiple NFTs owned by the user), the call will revert.

## Impact

Intended functionality is broken, the approved address should be able to harvest rewards. Users usually set up a automation to regularly harvest rewards from their positions, all such calls will fail even though the use of ```_requireOnlyApprovedOrOwnerOf()``` check shows that it should be allowed.

## Recommendation
Allow the approved address to call this function.
