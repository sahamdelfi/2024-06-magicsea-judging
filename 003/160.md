# Denial of Service via Out-of-Gas in harvestPositionsTo

## Summary

The [harvestPositionsTo function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/MlumStaking.sol#L470) within the [MlumStaking contract](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/MlumStaking.sol) uses a loop to process multiple positions, which can be exploited to cause a denial of service by exceeding the gas limit when processing a large number of positions.

## Vulnerability Detail

The function processes multiple positions in a loop. If a user stakes tokens to create a large number of positions and then calls harvestPositionsTo with all these positions, the function may exceed the gas limit and fail, causing a denial of service.

Proof of Concept:
1. User stakes tokens to create 1000 positions.
2. User calls harvestPositionsTo with all positions.
3. The function exceeds the gas limit, causing it to fail and resulting in a denial of service.

## Impact

This vulnerability can be exploited to cause a denial of service, disrupting the normal operation of the staking pool.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/MlumStaking.sol#L470

```solidity
function harvestPositionsTo(uint256[] calldata tokenIds, address to) external override nonReentrant {
        _updatePool();

        uint256 length = tokenIds.length;

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; ++i) {
            uint256 tokenId = tokenIds[i];
            _requireOnlyApprovedOrOwnerOf(tokenId);
            address tokenOwner = ERC721Upgradeable.ownerOf(tokenId);
            // if sender is the current owner, must also be the harvest dst address
            // if sender is approved, current owner must be a contract
            require(
                (msg.sender == tokenOwner && msg.sender == to), // legacy || tokenOwner.isContract()
                "FORBIDDEN"
            );

            _harvestPosition(tokenId, to);
            _updateBoostMultiplierInfoAndRewardDebt(_stakingPositions[tokenId]);
        }
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement a batching mechanism or a limit on the number of positions that can be processed in a single transaction. This can help prevent the function from exceeding the gas limit.
