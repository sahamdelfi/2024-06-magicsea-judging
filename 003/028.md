# `MlumStaking.sol#harvestPositionsTo` function doesn't function properly.

## Summary
`MlumStaking.sol#harvestPositionsTo` function can't be called by approved owner and can't send reward to the address which is not the token owner.
However `MlumStaking.sol#harvestPositionTo` function can be called by approved owner and can send reward to any address.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `harvestPositionTo` and `harvestPositionsTo` functions of `MlumStaking.sol` are as follows.
```solidity
    function harvestPositionTo(uint256 tokenId, address to) external override nonReentrant {
        _requireOnlyApprovedOrOwnerOf(tokenId);
        // legacy: require(ERC721.ownerOf(tokenId).isContract(), "FORBIDDEN");

        _updatePool();
        _harvestPosition(tokenId, to);
        _updateBoostMultiplierInfoAndRewardDebt(_stakingPositions[tokenId]);
    }
    ......
    function harvestPositionsTo(uint256[] calldata tokenIds, address to) external override nonReentrant {
        _updatePool();

        uint256 length = tokenIds.length;

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; ++i) {
            uint256 tokenId = tokenIds[i];
            _requireOnlyApprovedOrOwnerOf(tokenId);
            address tokenOwner = ERC721Upgradeable.ownerOf(tokenId);
            // if sender is the current owner, must also be the harvest dst address
            // if sender is approved, current owner must be a contract
            require(
482:            (msg.sender == tokenOwner && msg.sender == to), // legacy || tokenOwner.isContract()
                "FORBIDDEN"
            );

            _harvestPosition(tokenId, to);
            _updateBoostMultiplierInfoAndRewardDebt(_stakingPositions[tokenId]);
        }
    }
```
As can be seen, by `L482`, the `harvestPositionsTo` function can be called only by `tokenOwner` and can send reward only to the `tokenOwner`.
However, since the `harvestPositionTo` function can be called by approved owner and can send reward to any address, the limitation of `harvestPositionsTo` function is meaningless and not necessary.

## Impact
`MlumStaking.sol#harvestPositionsTo` function can't be called by approved owner and can't send reward to the address which is not the token owner.
This means that `MlumStaking.sol#harvestPositionsTo` function doesn't function properly.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The significance of the `harvestPositionsTo` function compared to `harvestPositionTo` function is only to save gas by bundling multiple transactions into one.
Therefore, there is no need of additional limitation for caller and reward receiver.
Modify the `harvestPositionsTo` function as follows.
```solidity
    function harvestPositionsTo(uint256[] calldata tokenIds, address to) external override nonReentrant {
        _updatePool();

        uint256 length = tokenIds.length;

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; ++i) {
            uint256 tokenId = tokenIds[i];
            _requireOnlyApprovedOrOwnerOf(tokenId);
            address tokenOwner = ERC721Upgradeable.ownerOf(tokenId);
            // if sender is the current owner, must also be the harvest dst address
            // if sender is approved, current owner must be a contract
-           require(
-               (msg.sender == tokenOwner && msg.sender == to), // legacy || tokenOwner.isContract()
-               "FORBIDDEN"
-           );

            _harvestPosition(tokenId, to);
            _updateBoostMultiplierInfoAndRewardDebt(_stakingPositions[tokenId]);
        }
    }
```
