# the check of weather sender is current owner is incorrect

## Summary
`harvestPositionsTo` intend to check current sender must be the harvest dst address if sender is current owner.

## Vulnerability Detail

From the comment we can see developer intend to check dst address when sender is current owner [link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/MlumStaking.sol#L479)

> if sender is the current owner, must also be the harvest dst address.

```solidity
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; ++i) {
            uint256 tokenId = tokenIds[i];
            _requireOnlyApprovedOrOwnerOf(tokenId);
            address tokenOwner = ERC721Upgradeable.ownerOf(tokenId);
            // if sender is the current owner, must also be the harvest dst address.   <@
            // if sender is approved, current owner must be a contract
            require(
                (msg.sender == tokenOwner && msg.sender == to), // legacy || tokenOwner.isContract()
                "FORBIDDEN"
            );
```

however the condition in require is `msg.sender == tokenOwner && msg.sender == to`

## Impact
the check is incorrent lead to dst address is useless
