# Incorrect validation logic in `harvestPositionsTo` function restricts functionality in `MlumStaking`


## Summary
The `harvestPositionsTo` function is designed to be called by the owner or approved address of lsNFT to harvest rewards for multiple positions.
However, the validation logic is incorrect, as it only allows the owner of the lsNFT to call the function, and the `to` address must be the owner.

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
    /**
     * @dev Harvest from multiple staking positions to "to" address
     *
     * Can only be called by lsNFT's owner or approved address
     */
    function harvestPositionsTo(uint256[] calldata tokenIds, address to) external override nonReentrant {
        _updatePool();

        uint256 length = tokenIds.length;

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; ++i) {
            uint256 tokenId = tokenIds[i];
            _requireOnlyApprovedOrOwnerOf(tokenId);
            address tokenOwner = ERC721Upgradeable.ownerOf(tokenId);
            // if sender is the current owner, must also be the harvest dst address
            // if sender is approved, current owner must be a contract
            require(
                (msg.sender == tokenOwner && msg.sender == to), // legacy || tokenOwner.isContract()
                "FORBIDDEN"
            ); // @audit -med only owner can pass this check & to address must be the owner

            _harvestPosition(tokenId, to);
            _updateBoostMultiplierInfoAndRewardDebt(_stakingPositions[tokenId]);
        }
    }
```

## Impact
This issue restricts the functionality of the `harvestPositionsTo` function, as only the owner of the lsNFT can call the function, and the `to` address must be the owner.
The intended functionality is to allow either the `owner` or an `approved` address to harvest rewards for multiple positions.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Remove the validation that requires the `to` address to be the owner of the lsNFT and modify the function to allow either the owner or an approved address to harvest rewards for multiple positions.
