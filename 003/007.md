# `harvestPositionsTo()` is not callable by the approved address

## Summary

The MlumStaking.sol contract includes a function, `harvestPositionsTo()`, intended to allow either the owner or an approved address to withdraw rewards from multiple positions. However, the current implementation only permits the owner to call this function due to a restrictive check, causing calls by approved addresses to revert. This results in incorrect access restrictions for the `harvestPositionsTo()` function.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `MlumStaking.sol` contract includes a possibility for a caller to withdraw the rewards from multiple positions at once. This function should be callable "by the lsNFT's owner or approved address" as per the NatSpec.

```solidity
/**
 * @dev Harvest from multiple staking positions to "to" address
 *
 * Can only be called by lsNFT's owner or approved address
 */
function harvestPositionsTo(uint256[] calldata tokenIds, address to) external override nonReentrant {
    _updatePool();

    uint256 length = tokenIds.length;

    for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; ++i) {
        uint256 tokenId = tokenIds[i];
        _requireOnlyApprovedOrOwnerOf(tokenId);
        address tokenOwner = ERC721Upgradeable.ownerOf(tokenId);
        // if sender is the current owner, must also be the harvest dst address
        // if sender is approved, current owner must be a contract
        require(
            (msg.sender == tokenOwner && msg.sender == to), // legacy || tokenOwner.isContract()
            "FORBIDDEN"
        );

        _harvestPosition(tokenId, to);
        _updateBoostMultiplierInfoAndRewardDebt(_stakingPositions[tokenId]);
    }
}
```

The problem is that due to the following check only, the owner will be able to call this function.

```solidity
require(
    (msg.sender == tokenOwner && msg.sender == to), // legacy || tokenOwner.isContract()
    "FORBIDDEN"
);
```

As a result, all calls by the approved address will revert.

## Impact

This issue results in incorrect access restrictions for the `harvestPositionsTo()` function.

## Recommendation

We recommend adapting the access restrictions to allow the approved address to call the function.
