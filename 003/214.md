# `harvestPositionTo` should  always send rewards to owner of NFT.

## Summary
`MlumStaking:harvestPositionTo` should be only called by the owner and the harvest rewards should always go to the NFT owner instead of the arbitrary to address. 
## Vulnerability Detail
`MlumStaking:harvestPositionTo` is a critical function responsible for distributing the unclaimed rewards to the user.

```solidity
function harvestPositionTo(
        uint256 tokenId,
        address to
    ) external override nonReentrant {
        //@audit should only be called by owner or validate `to` address
        _requireOnlyApprovedOrOwnerOf(tokenId);
        // legacy: require(ERC721.ownerOf(tokenId).isContract(), "FORBIDDEN");

        _updatePool();
        _harvestPosition(tokenId, to);
        _updateBoostMultiplierInfoAndRewardDebt(_stakingPositions[tokenId]);
    }
```

The check here ensures that the caller of this function is either an approved address or an owner of the NFT. The approved address is not fully trusted and it might steal an ownerâ€™s rewards by passing an arbitrary `to` address as a parameter. 
## Impact
Owner of an NFT could lose their rewards.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The check here should ensure that only the owner is calling the harvest function. even if the approved address is allowed it should always send the rewards to the owner of the NFT.
