# `harvestPositionsTo` will not work as expected

## Summary
In the natspec the harvestPositionsTo from `MlumStaking` is said to be " Can only be called by lsNFT's owner or approved address", however the function will not be callable by the approved users.
## Vulnerability Detail
There are overly restrictive checks that will not allow approved address to call `harvestPositionsTo`:
```solidity
 require(
                (msg.sender == tokenOwner && msg.sender == to), // legacy || tokenOwner.isContract()
                "FORBIDDEN"
            );
``` 
This check not only requires the msg.sender to be the owner but it also requires the to address to be the owner too.
As a result the function will not work as expected.
## Impact
Approved users will not be able to call this fuction.
