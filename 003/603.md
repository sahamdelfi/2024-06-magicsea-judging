# Users whose their address is blocklisted by stakeToken may not be able to withdraw

## Summary
User may not be able to withdraw if the stakeToken blocklisted his address

## Vulnerability Detail
The `withdrawFromPosition` function of MlumStaking.sol contract calls `_withdrawFromPosition` internal function which at the end transferred stakeToken to the owner of the lpNFT. When the stakeToken block-listed the lpNFT's owner address the `withdrawFromPosition` function call will always revert which prevent the lpNFT's owner from withdrawing his stake. Also `emergencyWithdraw` function is affected to this bug.

## Impact
User may not be able to withdraw if the stakeToken blocklisted his address

```javascript
function _withdrawFromPosition(address nftOwner, uint256 tokenId, uint256 amountToWithdraw) internal {
    require(amountToWithdraw > 0, "null");
    // withdrawFromPosition: amount cannot be null

    StakingPosition storage position = _stakingPositions[tokenId];
    require(
        _unlockOperators.contains(nftOwner)
            || (position.startLockTime + position.lockDuration) <= _currentBlockTimestamp() || isUnlocked(),
        "locked"
    );
    // withdrawFromPosition: invalid amount
    require(position.amount >= amountToWithdraw, "invalid");

    _harvestPosition(tokenId, nftOwner);

    // update position
    position.amount = position.amount - amountToWithdraw;

    // update total lp supply
    _stakedSupply = _stakedSupply - amountToWithdraw;

    if (position.amount == 0) {
        // destroy if now empty
        _stakedSupplyWithMultiplier = _stakedSupplyWithMultiplier - position.amountWithMultiplier;
        _destroyPosition(tokenId);
    } else {
        _updateBoostMultiplierInfoAndRewardDebt(position);
    }

    emit WithdrawFromPosition(tokenId, amountToWithdraw);
@>  stakedToken.safeTransfer(nftOwner, amountToWithdraw);
}
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Provide another function which will allow lpNFT owners to withdraw to different address.
