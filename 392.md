# 'Voter::vote' executes with no matter pool address is valid or not

## Summary
'Voter::vote' execution won't stop, if `_poolValidator == address(0)`, which allows users to vote in every pool address they want, no matter it's considered as valid or not

## Vulnerability Detail
As we can see when user calls 'Voter::vote', the function checks if the pool is valid, only if `_poolValidator != address(0)`. However, in scenario where `_poolValidator` isn't set or intentionally set to be address(0), users are allowed to vote in whatever pool they want
```solidity
    function vote(uint256 tokenId, address[] calldata pools, uint256[] calldata deltaAmounts) external {

            .....

            if (address(validator) != address(0) && !validator.isValid(pool)) {
                revert Voter__PoolNotVotable();
            }

            .....
            
    }
```

## Impact
Users could waste their votes by adding them into invalid pool
