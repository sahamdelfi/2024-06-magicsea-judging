# Audit Report: Analysis of allowAccounts and disallowAccounts Functions

## Summary
This report audits the `allowAccounts` and `disallowAccounts` functions in the Booster contract. These functions enable the contract owner to bulk update the allow list of addresses. However, the current implementation has some vulnerabilities and inefficiencies that need to be addressed.
## Vulnerability Detail
### Function:  `allowAccounts` and `disallowAccounts`
If any address in the input array is invalid, the entire transaction is reverted. This can be costly in terms of gas fees, especially if the input array is large. Additionally, the transaction reverts after processing all valid addresses up to the invalid one, resulting in wasted computation.


## Impact
Low- These vulnerabilities and inefficiencies can lead to unnecessary gas costs and failed transactions, especially when dealing with large arrays of addresses. This can make the contract less user-friendly and more costly to operate.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Address Checksum Validation: Validate addresses **off-chain** before submitting transactions to ensure they follow the correct checksum format. This can prevent transactions from being reverted due to invalid addresses.

- Remove Redundant Null Address Check: Consider removing the redundant check for null addresses in the disallowAccounts function to simplify the code and improve readability.
