# Use safeTransferFrom() instead of transferFrom() for erc721 transfers

## Summary

It is recommended to use safeTransferFrom() instead of transferFrom() when transferring ERC721.

## Vulnerability Detail

The recipient could have logic in the onERC721Received() function, which is only triggered in the safeTransferFrom() function and not in transferFrom()

## Impact

there is the potential loss of NFTs If the recipient is unable to handle the sent ERC721s.
