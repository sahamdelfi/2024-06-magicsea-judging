# Use safeTransferFrom instead of transferFrom for ERC721 transfers

## Summary
It is recommended to use safeTransferFrom() instead of transferFrom()

## Vulnerability Detail
Based on the OpenZeppelin standard (https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/erc721#IERC721-transferFrom-address-address-uint256-), it is not recommended to use transferFrom. The contract should only allow safeTransferFrom instead to prevent any potential loss

## Impact
Caller is responsible to confirm that the recipient is capable of receiving ERC721 or else they may be permanently lost.
