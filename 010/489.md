# `MlumStaking:safeTransferFrom` will not work as expected hence failing in transfer of TokenId.

## Summary
`MlumStaking:safeTransferFrom` is made to transfer the Position's tokenId .
## Vulnerability Detail
`MlumStaking:safeTransferFrom` overrides `ERC721Upgradeable and IERC721`,  also  `MlumStaking:transferFrom` overrides `ERC721Upgradeable, IERC721` Now let's go with the execution. Aslo note that `MlumStaking:safeTransferFrom`  and `MlumStaking:transferFrom` has `nonReentrant` modifier.

```solidity
user => MlumStaking:safeTransferFrom => ERC721Upgradeable.safeTransferFrom => transferFrom(MlumStaking:transferFrom)// Here Execution halts due to non reentrant modifier both the function using
```
`ERC721Upgradeable.safeTransferFrom` calls `ERC721Upgradeable.transferFrom` this function is overriden by the `MlumStaking:transferFrom` so the execution will get here and will fail due to non-reentrant modifier. As if user tries to burn using `safeTransferFrom` , sending it to address(0), this functionality will not work, due to above explained reasons.
## Impact
* Users will not be able to use the this functionality as expected , breaking the functionality of the contract.
* Functionality is not working as expected by the protocol.
