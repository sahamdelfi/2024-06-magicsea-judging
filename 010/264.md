# safeTransferFrom() function will never work as intended

## Summary
The `safeTransferFrom()` function will never work as intended because of the usage of `nonReentrantModifier()`.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `nonReentrant` modifier is used in `transferFrom()` and `safeTransferFrom()` functions. Since there is an additional public call to `safeTransferFrom(from, to, tokenId, "")` in `safeTransferFrom()`, the `nonReentrant` modifier will prevent this second call to be performed, leading to an unexpected revert every time that `safeTransferFrom()` is called.

## Impact
The `safeTransferFrom()` function will revert every time with `ReentrancyGuardReentrantCall()`, not working as intended.

```solidity
    /**
     * @dev Add nonReentrant to ERC721.safeTransferFrom
     */
    function safeTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId, bytes memory _data)
        public
        override(ERC721Upgradeable, IERC721)
        nonReentrant
    {
        ERC721Upgradeable.safeTransferFrom(from, to, tokenId, _data);
    }
```
