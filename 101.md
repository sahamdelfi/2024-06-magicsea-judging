# Tokens with Multiple Addresses (Proxied Tokens) Can Bypass Checks in `BaseRewarder::sweep`

# Tokens with Multiple Addresses (Proxied Tokens) Can Bypass Checks in `BaseRewarder::sweep`
## Summary
In decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, reward mechanisms often include functionality to sweep excess tokens back to a designated account, typically controlled by the protocol owner. This feature is crucial for managing liquidity and ensuring that the protocol operates efficiently. However, when dealing with proxied tokens—tokens that may have multiple addresses due to proxy contracts or similar mechanisms—a vulnerability arises. Specifically, checks designed to prevent the sweeping of the main reward token, thereby protecting unclaimed rewards or reserves, can be circumvented. This loophole allows the owner to potentially drain the rewarder's main reward token, posing a significant risk to users' rewards.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `sweep` function is intended to transfer any remaining tokens to a specified account. It includes a safeguard: if the token being swept is the main reward token, the function reduces the amount transferred by unclaimed rewards or reserves. This ensures users are not robbed of their rewards. However, if the main token is a proxied token with multiple addresses, this check can be bypassed. An attacker, with control over the contract (typically the owner), could exploit this by initiating a sweep operation that ignores the safeguards, leading to the depletion of the rewarder's main reward token.

```javascript
/**
 * @dev Transfers any remaining tokens to the specified account.
 * If the token is the reward token, only the excess amount will be transferred.
 * Even if the rewarder is stopped, the unclaimed rewards will not be transferred; unless the total supply is 0.
 * (for example if there is leftover because of emergency withdrawal or roundings).
 * @param token The token to transfer.
 * @param account The account to transfer the tokens to.
 */
 function sweep(
        IERC20 token,
        address account
    ) public virtual override onlyOwner {
        uint256 balance = _balanceOfThis(token);
@>      if (token == _token()) {
@>          if (_isStopped) {
@>              if (_getTotalSupply() > 0) balance -= _totalUnclaimedRewards;
@>          } else {
@>              balance -= _reserve;
@>          }
@>      }
        if (balance == 0) revert BaseRewarder__ZeroAmount();

        _safeTransferTo(token, account, balance);

        emit Swept(token, account, balance);
    }
```
## Impact
The impact of this vulnerability is significant. It allows the owner of the contract to bypass intended safeguards and potentially drain the contract of its main reward token. This action could leave users without their earned rewards, undermining trust in the protocol and leading to potential financial losses.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate this vulnerability, it's recommended to ensure that the balance of the token does not change adversely at the end of the `sweep` transaction. This can be achieved by comparing the balance of the reward token before and after the sweep operation and reverting the transaction if there's an unexpected decrease.

```diff
 function sweep(
        IERC20 token,
        address account
    ) public virtual override onlyOwner {
        uint256 balance = _balanceOfThis(token);
+       uint256 rewardTokenBalanceBefore = _balanceOfThis(_token());
        if (token == _token()) {
            if (_isStopped) {
                if (_getTotalSupply() > 0) balance -= _totalUnclaimedRewards;
            } else {
                balance -= _reserve;
            }
        }
        if (balance == 0) revert BaseRewarder__ZeroAmount();

        _safeTransferTo(token, account, balance);
+        if (token != _token() && _balanceOfThis(_token()) < rewardTokenBalanceBefore ){
+            revert("custome error");
+        }
        emit Swept(token, account, balance);
    }
```

This modification adds an additional layer of security by ensuring that the `sweep` function cannot be exploited to drain the contract of its main reward token, thus protecting users' rewards.
