# Out-of-Gas Errors in _notifyBribes Function Due to Unbounded Loop

## Summary

The [_notifyBribes function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/Voter.sol#L221) uses a loop to notify all bribe rewarders, which can cause out-of-gas errors if there are too many bribe rewarders registered for a period and pool.

## Vulnerability Detail

The _notifyBribes function iterates over all bribe rewarders for a given period and pool without any limitation. If a large number of bribe rewarders are registered, this can lead to out-of-gas errors, causing the function to fail.

- A large number of bribe rewarders are registered for a period and pool.
- Calling _notifyBribes for this period and pool iterates over all bribe rewarders.
- If the number of bribe rewarders is high, the function can exceed the gas limit, causing out-of-gas errors.

## Impact

The issue occurs if many bribe rewarders are registered for the same period and pool. Out-of-gas errors can prevent the function from completing, leading to missed bribe notifications and potential financial discrepancies.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function _notifyBribes(uint256 periodId, address pool, uint256 tokenId, uint256 deltaAmount) private {
    IBribeRewarder[] storage rewarders = _bribesPerPriod[periodId][pool];
    uint256 maxBatchSize = 10; // Example batch size limit
    uint256 processed = 0;

    for (uint256 i = 0; i < rewarders.length && processed < maxBatchSize; ++i) {
        if (address(rewarders[i]) != address(0)) {
            rewarders[i].deposit(periodId, tokenId, deltaAmount);
            _userBribesPerPeriod[periodId][tokenId].push(rewarders[i]);
            processed++;
        }
    }
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement batching or a limit on the number of bribe rewarders that can be processed in a single transaction:

```solidity
function _notifyBribes(uint256 periodId, address pool, uint256 tokenId, uint256 deltaAmount) private {
    IBribeRewarder[] storage rewarders = _bribesPerPriod[periodId][pool];
    uint256 maxBatchSize = 10; // Example batch size limit
    uint256 processed = 0;

    for (uint256 i = 0; i < rewarders.length && processed < maxBatchSize; ++i) {
        if (address(rewarders[i]) != address(0)) {
            rewarders[i].deposit(periodId, tokenId, deltaAmount);
            _userBribesPerPeriod[periodId][tokenId].push(rewarders[i]);
            processed++;
        }
    }
}
```
This ensures that the function does not exceed the gas limit by processing a limited number of bribe rewarders in each call.
