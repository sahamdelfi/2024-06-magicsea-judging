# Partially `withdrawFromPosition` allow users to gain extra rewards.

## Summary
See detail.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `withdrawFromPosition` function allow users to withdraw their staked tokens and harvest tokens after their lock duration passes. However the function calls `_harvestPosition` function internally before `_updateBoostMultiplierInfoAndRewardDebt` function which is responsible for updating user's `amountWithMultiplier` with latest amount.  So the problem is here that when a user withdraws partially, the `_harvestPosition` function calculates rewards based on the initial `amountWithMultiplier` before updating it. This allows users to collect rewards twice: first based on the full staked amount and then again after updating the multiplier.


```javascript
function _withdrawFromPosition(address nftOwner, uint256 tokenId, uint256 amountToWithdraw) internal {
        require(amountToWithdraw > 0, "null");
        // withdrawFromPosition: amount cannot be null

        StakingPosition storage position = _stakingPositions[tokenId];
        require(
            _unlockOperators.contains(nftOwner)
                || (position.startLockTime + position.lockDuration) <= _currentBlockTimestamp() || isUnlocked(),
            "locked"
        );
        // withdrawFromPosition: invalid amount
        require(position.amount >= amountToWithdraw, "invalid");

@>       _harvestPosition(tokenId, nftOwner);

        // update position
        position.amount = position.amount - amountToWithdraw;

        // update total lp supply
        _stakedSupply = _stakedSupply - amountToWithdraw;

        if (position.amount == 0) {
            // destroy if now empty
            _stakedSupplyWithMultiplier = _stakedSupplyWithMultiplier - position.amountWithMultiplier;
            _destroyPosition(tokenId);
        } else {
@>          _updateBoostMultiplierInfoAndRewardDebt(position);
        }

        emit WithdrawFromPosition(tokenId, amountToWithdraw);
        stakedToken.safeTransfer(nftOwner, amountToWithdraw);
    }
```

Let's consider a scenario to better understand:

- Bob stakes 10 tokens for 90 days.
- The `amountWithMultiplier` = 1.5x , 1.5*10 = 15 , `stakedAmount` = 10.
- After 90 days Bob calls `_withdrawFromPosition` to withdraw 5 tokens.
- Bob will receive rewards according to his initial `amountWithMultiplier` = 15.
- Gather rewards with `amountWithMultiplier(15)` ,now `stakedAmount` = 5.
- The `amountWithMultiplier`  updated = 1.5x , 1.5*5 = 7.5.
- Bob calls `_withdrawFromPosition` again to withdraw remaining 5 staked tokens.
- And gather more rewards with `amountWithMultiplier(7.5)`.

In this scenario Bob was able to steal `amountWithMultiplier(7.5)` rewards token by withdrawing partially.


## Impact
Partial withdrawls will be beneficial for malicious users to steal reward tokens from the system.
The impact will drastically increase by extending partial withdrawals and locking high quantity of tokens with `_maxLockDuration`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adjust the interal `_harvestPosition` function after the user's `amountWithMultiplier` updates. That will 
always harvest user's rewards according to updated `amountWithMultiplier`.
