# MasterchefV2 exhibits inherent incompatibility issues with LB pools.

## Summary  
Although the protocol is supposed to let both V2 and LB pools be added to the masterchefV2 and earn rewards, adding the latter wont be possible since the masterchef assumes the tokens are going to be Erc20s when those of the LB are ERC1155  

## Vulnerability Detail  
The following bolded words in the readme, of this audit repo should be sufficient proof that LB pools are to be added to `MasterChefV2` because they demonstrate clearly and explictly that there will be bribes and voting for LB pairs, and the only purpose for those 2 things is to get a pool added and give it weight so that its stakers earn rewards.

> Voter: Voting contract for voting on Uniswap V2 and **LB** pairs. Voters need a MLUM staking position.

> BribeRewarders: Bribe pools (V2 / **LB**) for getting votes

Now the problem is that the Lp tokens of LB pools, which is a mechanism introduced by [Trader Joe](https://github.com/traderjoe-xyz/joe-v2/blob/main/src/LBToken.sol) which the protocol is a fork of, are ERC1155.

Erc1155 tokens need to be passed an additional ID parameter, and if called using Erc20safe operations or using the Erc20 interface like is done in the `MasterChefV2` the calls will fail.

As it can be seen here before, the addition of a new pool `balanceOf` is called on the lp token as a sanity check and it will always fail here on with LB tokens since the function doesn`t exist.

```solidity  
MasterchefV2.sol#L381

token.balanceOf(address(this)); // sanity check  
```

## Impact  
At the time of publishing this, out of the top 5 liquidity pools in terms of volume on IoTa 4 are of the type LB and only one is of the type V2:

## Tool used  
Manual Review  
## Recommendation  
Consider making a low-level call to both `balanceOf(address)` and `balanceOf(address,id)` and then storing the type of token based on which call succeeds.

Since liquidity carry an equal liquidity value irrespective of the bin(id) it is contained in as is mentioned [in section 3.5 of the Liquidity Book whitepaper](https://github.com/traderjoe-xyz/LB-Whitepaper/blob/main/Joe%20v2%20Liquidity%20Book%20Whitepaper.pdf), you can store liquidity deposited from all ids of a specific LB token togather.

You can then add seperate branches for transferfrom and trasnfer based on wether the token is of type LB or V2
