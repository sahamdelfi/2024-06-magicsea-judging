# The votes for the different epochs will add up causing all the pools to recieve lums in the long run

## Summary
The `_votes `and `_userVotes `in Voter.sol will keep adding up across different epochs, which allows pools with less than the `_minimumVotesPerPool` votes for them in that epoch to be eligible for lum emissions.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the `vote()` function in Voter.sol, the number of votes for the given pool is being accumulated each time a user votes. 
```solidity
 if (_votes.contains(pool)) {
                _votes.set(pool, _votes.get(pool) + deltaAmount);
            } else {
                _votes.set(pool, deltaAmount);
            }
```
And this `votes` value is being used in the startNewVotingPeriod() function to validate that the pool has more than the `_minimumVotesPerPool` votes in that epoch. 
```solidity
function createFarms(address[] calldata pools) external onlyOwner {
        uint256 farmLengths = _masterChef.getNumberOfFarms();
        uint256 minimumVotes = _minimumVotesPerPool;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < pools.length; ++i) {
            if (_votes.get(pools[i]) >= minimumVotes && !hasFarm(pools[i], farmLengths)) {
                _masterChef.add(IERC20(pools[i]), IMasterChefRewarder(address(0)));
            }
        }
    }
```
Since when a new voting period is started the `_votes `value is not being updated to 0, this effect will snowball as the number of epochs completed increase. 
```solidity
function startNewVotingPeriod() public onlyOwner {
        _currentVotingPeriodId++;

        VotingPeriod storage period = _startTimes[_currentVotingPeriodId];
        period.startTime = block.timestamp;
        period.endTime = block.timestamp + _periodDuration;

        emit VotingPeriodStarted();
    }
```
The keeper bot cannot update the value of `_votes `and `_userVotes` to 0 after every epoch since there is not function to set their values.
## Impact
This over a long period of time will cause all the pools to have more than the `_minimumVotesPerPool`  number of votes. Thus allowing all the pools to recieve lum emissions.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Add a setVotes() function so that the keeper bot can update the values at the start of every epoch, or
- change the startNewVotingPeriod() function to update these variables.
