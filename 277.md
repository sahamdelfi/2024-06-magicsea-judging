# Audit Report: Lock Time Manipulation Vulnerability in Booster::deposit Function of Booster Contract

## Summary
In the `Booster::deposit` function of `magicsea-staking/src/booster/Booster.sol`, an attacker can manipulate the `user.lockedAt` while depositing tokens. This vulnerability allows an attacker to reduce the lock time for future deposits, potentially converting their LUM to Magic LUM tokens in a significantly shorter period.
## Vulnerability Detail
**Issue:** Manipulation of Lock Time Calculation
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/booster/Booster.sol#L389-L404

The vulnerability lies in the calculation of the average lock time using the formula:
```diff
uint256 amount_old = amount;

uint256 userAmount = amount + _amount;
uint256 _time_locked = time_locked; // gas savings
- uint256 lockedFor = timeToUnlock(msg.sender);

-   lockedFor = (lockedFor * amount_old + _time_locked * _amount) / userAmount;
```

When `timeToUnlock(msg.sender)` returns 0, the attacker can manipulate the lock time for their subsequent deposits. This happens because lockedFor can be zero if timeToUnlock(msg.sender) returns 0, which is possible if the required lock time has already elapsed.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/booster/Booster.sol#L791-L796

By making a large deposit, the attacker can significantly influence the lockedFor value. This allows the attacker to reduce the lock time for future deposits, enabling them to convert their LUM to Magic LUM tokens much faster than intended.

**Detailed Explanation of Vulnerability:**
- Initial Deposit: The attacker makes an initial deposit. When the lock time elapses, `timeToUnlock(msg.sender)` will return 0.
- Subsequent Deposits: When the attacker makes subsequent deposits, the calculation `(lockedFor * amount_old + _time_locked * _amount) / userAmount` can be manipulated. If lockedFor is 0, the formula simplifies to (_time_locked * _amount) / userAmount, which reduces the average lock time for the new deposit.
- Manipulation: By strategically timing their deposits and leveraging the above calculation, the attacker can continuously reduce their lock time, converting their tokens faster than intended and gaining an unfair advantage.
Example:
Assume the attacker initially deposits 10000 tokens with a lock time of 72hr. After 72hr, `timeToUnlock` returns 0. If the attacker then deposits an additional 100 tokens, the new lock time calculation is skewed due to the zero value of lockedFor, significantly reducing the lock period by 99%.


## Impact
**High -** This vulnerability allows an attacker to reduce the lock time for their staked tokens, enabling them to convert their LUM to Magic LUM tokens much faster than intended. This undermines the staking mechanism and can lead to an unfair advantage and potential exploitation of the reward system.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate this vulnerability, add a condition to ensure `lockedFor` is not set to 0. If `timeToUnlock(msg.sender)` returns 0, set `lockedFor` to `_time_locked`. Here's the updated code:
```diff
function deposit(uint256 _amount) external nonReentrant onlyAllowed {
    UserInfo storage user = userInfo[msg.sender];

    if (!user.initialized) {
        users.push(msg.sender);
        user.initialized = true;
    }
    _updatePool();

    (uint256 rewards, uint256 amount, uint256 rewardDebt) = _computeSnapshotRewards(user);

    // we save the rewards (if any so far) for harvesting
    user.rewardClaim = user.rewardClaim + rewards;

    uint256 amount_old = amount;

    uint256 userAmount = amount + _amount;

    uint256 _burnAfterTime = burnAfterTime; // gas savings
    uint256 _stakedSupply = stakedSupply + _amount;

    totalBurnMultiplier = (_stakedSupply * PRECISION_FACTOR) / (_burnAfterTime);
    totalBurnUntil = block.timestamp + _burnAfterTime;
    stakedSupply = _stakedSupply;

    // set new locked amount based on average locking window
    uint256 _time_locked = time_locked; // gas savings
    uint256 lockedFor = timeToUnlock(msg.sender);
-    // avg lockedFor: (lockedFor * amount_old + blocks_locked * _amount) / user.amount
-   lockedFor = (lockedFor * amount_old + _time_locked * _amount) / userAmount;

+  // Ensure lockedFor is not manipulated
+    if (lockedFor != 0) {
+       lockedFor = (lockedFor * amount_old + _time_locked * _amount) / userAmount;
+    } else {
+       lockedFor = _time_locked;
+    }

    // set new locked at
    user.lockedAt = block.timestamp - (_time_locked - lockedFor);

    user.amount = userAmount;

    user.burnRound = lastBurnRound();

    user.rewardDebt = rewardDebt + ((_amount * accTokenPerShare) / PRECISION_FACTOR);

    // get tokens from user
    stakedToken.safeTransferFrom(address(msg.sender), address(this), _amount);

    emit DepositPosition(msg.sender, _amount);
}
```
By adding this condition, the lock time cannot be reduced to zero, preventing the attacker from manipulating the lock time to their advantage. This ensures that the staking mechanism remains fair and robust, maintaining the integrity of the reward distribution system.
