# Bribe Rewarder can not be paused

## Summary

The Masterchef rewarder as well as the BaseRewarder allow the owner to pause the claim of rewards.
This functionality is missing in BribeRewarder. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The BaseRewarder implements a stop function that when called by owner will set the reward distribution rate to zero, locking future reward distribution.

```solidity
function stop() public virtual override onlyOwner {
        if (_isStopped) revert BaseRewarder__AlreadyStopped();

        uint256 totalSupply = _getTotalSupply();
        uint256 totalPendingRewards = _rewarder.getTotalRewards(_rewardsPerSecond, _endTimestamp, totalSupply);

        _totalUnclaimedRewards += totalPendingRewards;
        _rewarder.updateAccDebtPerShare(totalSupply, totalPendingRewards);

        _setRewardParameters(0, block.timestamp, 0);

        _isStopped = true;

        emit Stopped();
    }
```

Similar functionality is provided in the Masterchef rewarder by unlinking it from Masterchef.

The BribeRewarder does not implement this, creating no way to pause the contract in case needed. 

## Impact

In case the briber needs to stop reward distribution he has no way of doing so.

## Recommendation

Add pausing and sweeping functionality to bribe rewarder. Or the possibility to remove briber from voting.
