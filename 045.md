# Tokens with less than 6 decimals will not be supported in BaseRewarder.sol

## Summary
In the readMe it is stated that any token can be a reward token. However due to precision the tokens with less decimals will not be supported by BaseRewarder.sol.
## Vulnerability Detail
The issue is in the `_setRewardParameters` function. The `rewardPerSecond` is calculated the following way:
```solidity
 rewardPerSecond = maxExpectedReward > remainingReward ? remainingReward / expectedDuration : maxRewardPerSecond;
```
If for example the expected duration is one year in seconds it equals: 31 536 000 seconds. 1 usdc is 1 000 000 which means that the new reward will need to be at least 31 usdc. However there are some more extreme tokens which are also supported by readMe like some tokens like [Gemini USD]only have 2 decimals which means that for these tokens the rewardPerSecond will always be 0 causing the `_setRewardParameters` to always revert here:
` if (expectedDuration != 0 && expectedReward == 0) revert BaseRewarder__ZeroReward();`

## Impact
DOS for tokens with less decimals.
