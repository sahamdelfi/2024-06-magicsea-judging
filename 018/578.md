# Protocol Incompatibility with Rebasing Tokens

## Summary
The protocol does not support rebasing, deflationary, or inflationary tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail
The protocol lacks the necessary checks to handle rebasing tokens. The Magic protocol does not appear to support rebasing, deflationary, or inflationary tokens whose balances change during transfers or over time.

Example:
Initial total supply: 100
Alice owns 80% (80 tokens), Bob owns 20% (20 tokens).
After a rebase that increases the total supply by 200:

New total supply: 300
Alice now owns 240 tokens (still 80%), Bob owns 60 tokens (still 20%).

## Impact
The protocol's inability to handle rebasing tokens can result in inaccurate token balances.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To support rebasing tokens, the protocol should store each holder stake as a percentage of the total supply instead of an absolute token amount. Additionally, implement functionality to ensure that deposits and withdrawals maintain the correct percentage of the total supply. This approach will accommodate changes in token balances due to rebasing.
