# Protocol is incompatible with rebase ERC20 tokens that have a mechanism for balance modifications outside of transfers

## Summary

The protocol does not work if the reward token is a rebase token that may make arbitrary balance modifications outside of transfers, for example, rebasing token like Ampleforth.

Note: MagicSea supports Any type of ERC20 token.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `MlumStaking` contract caches the `_lastRewardBalance`. If arbitrary balance modifications happens, the contract would handle with an outdated reward balance.

For example: 

1. The `_lastRewardBalance` is cached after `_updatePool()`.
2. After some time,  a rebase of the token balances has happened and now actually contract holds less tokens.
3. The function `pendingRewards()` returns an inaccurate reward amount.
4. The next round of `_updatePool()` accumulates incorrect `accruedReward`.

## Impact

Inaccurate rewards. Potentially lead to users receives less rewards than expected.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Document that the protocol does not support such tokens.
