# `createFarms` function can add duplicated token farms

## Summary

The `farmLengths` captures the count of farms at the start of the execution and it is not updated when a new farm is added to masterchef. So one token can have different farms in masterchef if the `pools` is wrong.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `farmLengths` captures the count of farms at the start of the execution and it is not updated when a new farm is added to masterchef.  So if the same token exists in `pools`, like
```solidity
pools[0] == tokenA
pools[1] == tokenA
```
`createFarms` function will add tokenA farm twice to masterchef.

## Impact

This logical flaw can lead to duplicate farms in the system, double-spending of rewards, confusion in farm management, and potential security risks or economic exploits regarding farm entry points.

## Recommendation

 Increase `farmLengths` by 1 when a new farm is created and added.
