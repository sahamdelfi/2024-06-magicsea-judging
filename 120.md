# Uneccesary check in Math::addDelta causes reverts if the

# Uneccesary check in Math::addDelta causes reverts if the 
## Summary
the addDelta should only check if the y is greater than `MAX_INT256`, this way if x is higher than MAX_INT256 and delta is a negative number so that the y is less than MAX_INT256. it wont revert and still works.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `addDelta` function is designed to add a signed integer (`delta`) to an unsigned integer (`x`) while ensuring that the result (`y`) remains within the bounds of `uint256` and does not cause an overflow. However, the current implementation includes a check that unnecessarily restricts the operation, causing reverts in scenarios where `x` is greater than `MAX_INT256` but the final result `y` (after adding `delta`) is within acceptable limits. Specifically, if `delta` is a negative number that brings `y` below `MAX_INT256`, the operation should still be valid, but the current checks prevent this.

```javascript
    /**
     * @dev Adds a signed integer to an unsigned integer with overflow check.
     * The result must be greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to MAX_INT256.
     * @param x Unsigned integer to add to.
     * @param delta Signed integer to add.
     * @return y The result of the addition.
     */
    function addDelta(
        uint256 x,
        int256 delta
    ) internal pure returns (uint256 y) {
        uint256 success;

        assembly {
            y := add(x, delta)

            success := iszero(
                or(
@>                  gt(x, MAX_INT256), 
@>                  gt(y, MAX_INT256) 
                )
            )
        }
        if (success == 0) revert Math__UnderOverflow();
    }
```
## Impact
The function will not work as intended when `x > MAX_INT256` but `x + delta = y <= MAX_INT256`. This limitation prevents valid operations from succeeding and can lead to unexpected reverts, impacting the usability and reliability of the function.

## Code Snippet
Add this test to existing test suit:
```javascript
contract LibTest is Test {
    function setUp() public {}

    function testAdd() public {
        uint256 x = uint256(type(int256).max) + 8;
        int256 y = -9;
        vm.expectRevert(Math.Math__UnderOverflow.selector);
        uint256 actualAnswer = Math.addDelta(x, y);
        assertEq(actualAnswer, uint256(type(int256).max) - 1);
    }
}
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The recommendation is to simplify the check to only verify that the result `y` does not exceed `MAX_INT256`, removing the unnecessary check for `x`. This adjustment ensures that the function behaves correctly in all valid scenarios.

        assembly {
