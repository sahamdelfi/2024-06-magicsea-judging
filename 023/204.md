# Potential issues with the ``BribeRewarder.sol`` contract, when the reward token is a Weird ERC20 token

## Summary
In the Readme of the contests it is explicitly stated that the protocol is expected to interact with different types of Weird ERC20 tokens. 
There are several problems that will arise in the ``BribeRewarder.sol`` contract, if such token is utilized as the reward token. 
- Tokens with [low decimals](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20?tab=readme-ov-file#low-decimals), for example if there are tokens with less than 6 decimals, a lot of precision will be lost when [_calculateRewards()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/rewarders/BribeRewarder.sol#L300-L313) function is called: 
```solidity
    function _calculateRewards(uint256 periodId) internal view returns (uint256) {
        (uint256 startTime, uint256 endTime) = IVoter(_caller).getPeriodStartEndtime(periodId);

        if (endTime == 0 || startTime > block.timestamp) {
            return 0;
        }

        uint256 duration = endTime - startTime;
        uint256 emissionsPerSecond = _amountPerPeriod / duration;

        uint256 lastUpdateTimestamp = _lastUpdateTimestamp;
        uint256 timestamp = block.timestamp > endTime ? endTime : block.timestamp;
        return timestamp > lastUpdateTimestamp ? (timestamp - lastUpdateTimestamp) * emissionsPerSecond : 0;
    }
```
Let's say the duration of a voting period is **2 weeks = 1209600 seconds**, and the reward token is a token with 2 decimals as the example previously linked and lets say the amount per period is **10_000e2** when **emissionsPerSecond** is calculated the result will be **0**. In this way none of the rewards will be distributed to users, and the rewards that are not distributed will be locked in the contract forever, as there is no way for them to be withdrawn. 
- [Rebasing tokens](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20?tab=readme-ov-file#balance-modifications-outside-of-transfers-rebasingairdrops) once deposited in the ``BribeRewarder.sol`` contract instance and the balance of the contract increases due to positive rebase, part of this balance will be locked in the contract forever. If a negative rebalance occurs however some users won't be able to claim their rewards. 
- [Fee on transfer tokens](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20?tab=readme-ov-file#balance-modifications-outside-of-transfers-rebasingairdrops). The [fundAndBribe()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/rewarders/BribeRewarder.sol#L111-L124) function will always revert if the reward tokens has fee on transfer, due to the following check in the [_bribe()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/rewarders/BribeRewarder.sol#L226-L258) function:
```solidity
    function _bribe(uint256 startId, uint256 lastId, uint256 amountPerPeriod) internal {
       ...

        uint256 totalAmount = _calcTotalAmount(startId, lastId, amountPerPeriod);

        uint256 balance = _balanceOfThis(_token());

        if (balance < totalAmount) revert BribeRewarder__InsufficientFunds();
        ...
    }
```
## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
There are several problems that arise in the ``BribeRewarder.sol`` contract, which will impact the reward distribution and normal functioning of all the ``BribeRewarder.sol`` contract instances, as described above.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider whitelisting certain tokens in the ``RewarderFactory.sol`` contract, and allow only this tokens to be used as a reward tokens for each ``BribeRewarder.sol`` contract instance created by users.
