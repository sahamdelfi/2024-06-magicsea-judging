# Missing function called on extraRewarder

## Summary
Missing function called on extraRewarder

## Vulnerability Detail
Extra rewarders in MagicSea are represented by `MasterChefRewarder.sol`. We can confirm this by looking at `MasterchefV2.sol: add()` function:
```solidity
function add(IERC20 token, IMasterChefRewarder extraRewarder) external override
```
As you can see the `extraRewarder` is set as `IMasterChefRewarder`.

An issue arises in the `MasterchefV2: getPendingRewards()`. This function is used to get the pending reward and it checks if an extra rewarder has been set and tries to get the pending extra rewards from it:

```solidity
if (address(extraRewarder) != address(0)) {
     (extraTokens[i], extraRewards[i]) = extraRewarder.getPendingReward(account, balance, totalSupply);
}
```
As you can see we call `getPendingReward` on the extra rewarder which is an `MasterChefRewarder.sol` implementation. However this contract does not have such function.

## Impact
Because `getPendingReward` is not implemented in `MasterChefRewarder.sol` the transaction will simply revert.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
There is no function in `MasterChefRewarder.sol` that can be used to get pending rewards without claiming anything. Implement one.
