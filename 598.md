# Usability Issue in vote Function Leading to Potential User Lockout

## Summary
The vote function in the contract allows users to vote for pools using a specific token ID. However, if users provide empty arrays for both pools and deltaAmounts, the function will set _hasVotedInPeriod to true without making any significant vote changes. This can inadvertently lock users out from voting in the current period without realizing their mistake.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vote function checks if the lengths of pools and deltaAmounts match but does not enforce that these arrays contain meaningful data. If a user mistakenly provides empty pools and deltaAmounts, the function will still set _hasVotedInPeriod to true, effectively preventing the user from voting again in the same period.

## Impact
Users can accidentally lock themselves out of voting for the current period by providing empty inputs.

## Recommendation
Implement a check to ensure that users provide at least one non-zero deltaAmount and pools in their votes.
