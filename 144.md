# Incorrect calculation for `PRECISION_FACTOR`

## Summary

In the contract [MlumStaking](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/MlumStaking.sol), the variable `PRECISION_FACTOR` is used for the conversion between two `ERC20` tokens with different decimal places, however, the current calculation will lead to massive inflation/deflation.

## Vulnerability Detail

Within the protocol, users can earn `LUM` tokens, which can then be upgraded to `Magic LUM`. That same `MLUM` can be staked in order to boost the users' rewards, and they can vote for LUM emissions in farms and staking pools. The current issue is that the variable `PRECISION_FACTOR`, used several times throughout the contract in order to convert the value from `stakedToken` to `rewardToken`, has its calculation set up inaccurately.

```solidity
 uint256 decimalsRewardToken = uint256(IERC20Metadata(address(_rewardToken)).decimals());
 require(decimalsRewardToken < 30, "Must be inferior to 30");

 PRECISION_FACTOR = uint256(10 ** (uint256(30) - decimalsRewardToken));
```

If the `PRECISION_FACTOR` is used as is, the reward token will be severely deflated if it has more than average decimals `> 18`. In comparison to that, if it has less than 18 decimals, its value will be inflated. This is all due to the hardcoded value of `uint256(30)`. `USDC` is a [confirmed](https://docs.magicsea.finance/protocol/magic/magic-lum-staking) reward token by the protocol, which has 6 decimals:
> All protocol returns like a part of the trading fees, Fairlaunch listing fees, and NFT trading fees flow into the staking pool in form of USDC. 

As a result, the incorrect `PRECISION_FACTOR` will lead to the functions [pendingRewards](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/MlumStaking.sol#L239-L257), [createPosition](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/MlumStaking.sol#L377), [_updatePool](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/MlumStaking.sol#L586), [_updateBoostMultiplierInfoAndRewardDebt](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/MlumStaking.sol#L667) and [_harvestPosition](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/MlumStaking.sol#L678), working with imprecise amount of rewards to give out to the users.

## Impact

If the value of the `reward` token is scaled up/down incorrectly, this can lead to a loss of funds for the user/protocol depending on the number of decimals of the token.

## Recommendation

One way to handle the conversion between the two tokens is:
```diff
    constructor(IERC20 _stakedToken, IERC20 _rewardToken) {
        _disableInitializers();

        require(address(_stakedToken) != address(0), "init: zero address");
        require(address(_rewardToken) != address(0), "init: zero address");

        stakedToken = _stakedToken;
        rewardToken = _rewardToken;

        uint256 decimalsRewardToken = uint256(IERC20Metadata(address(_rewardToken)).decimals());
        require(decimalsRewardToken < 30, "Must be inferior to 30");
        uint256 decimalsStakedToken  = uint256(IERC20Metadata(address(_stakedToken )).decimals());

-        PRECISION_FACTOR = uint256(10 ** (uint256(30) - decimalsRewardToken));
+        PRECISION_FACTOR = uint256(10 ** (decimalsStakedToken - decimalsRewardToken));

        _stakedSupply = 0;
    }
```

If `MLUM` is the only token planned to use as a staking token, the decimals of the `stakedToken` can be hardcoded as well.
