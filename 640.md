# Wrong initialization of BaseRewarder will lead to assigning wrong owner

## Summary & Details
The BaseRewarder.sol contract is the parent contract of MasterchefRewarder.sol hence its initialize function should use the onlyInitializing modifier as stated in openzeppelin's documentation, the BaseRewarder now is using the initializer modifier and that can lead to problems when initializing any contract inhereting from it.
## Impact
Wrong initialization of the contract may lead to assigning wrong owner

## Recommendation
Use onlyInitializing modifier instead of initializer in BaseRewarder.sol initialize() function.
