# MasterChefV2 Reentrancy Attack

## Summary

The MasterChefV2 contract can be exploited if it contains ERC-777 tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail

The lack of protection against reentrancy attacks, combined with the protocol's allowance of ERC-777 tokens, enables attackers to completely drain the contract.

The `MasterChefV2.deposit` function does not have reentrancy attack protection and increases the user's deposited amount before transferring the user's chosen amount of tokens to the contract. This allows an attacker to artificially inflate their deposited amount in the contract, and subsequently call `MasterChefV2.withdraw` to drain the tokens completely.

## Impact

Total loss of user funds.
