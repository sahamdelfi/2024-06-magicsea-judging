# `MasterChefRewarder`::`onModify()` lacks access control

## Summary
The comment for this function states that it will be "Called by the caller contract", and compared to other `onModify` functions, it doesn't restrict that `msg.sender` must be _caller.

## Vulnerability Detail
attacker using a victim's account and forge `oldBalance`, `newBalance`, `oldTotalSupply` to modify reward status of the victim.
## Impact
if `onModify()` misses access control, then a malicious attacker can modify the reward status of other users, preventing them from claiming their rewards or adding debt to their account.
