# Insufficient validation in `onModify` function

## Summary

Insufficient validation in `MasterChefRewarder's` `onModify` allows for user to arbitrary change balance of another user without permission.

## Vulnerability Detail



```solidity
    /**
     * @dev Called by the caller contract to update the rewards for a given account.
     * If the rewarder is not linked, the function will revert.
     * @param account The account to update rewards for.
     * @param pid The pool ID of the staking pool.
     * @param oldBalance The old balance of the account.
     * @param newBalance The new balance of the account.
     * @param oldTotalSupply The old total supply of the staking pool.
     * @return reward The amount of rewards sent to the account.
     */
function onModify(address account, uint256 pid, uint256 oldBalance, uint256 newBalance, uint256 oldTotalSupply)
        public
        override(BaseRewarder, IBaseRewarder)
        returns (uint256 reward)
    {
        
        if (_status != Status.Linked) revert MasterChefRewarder__NotLinked();

        reward = BaseRewarder.onModify(account, pid, oldBalance, newBalance, oldTotalSupply);

        _claim(account, reward);
    }
```

By the comments above you can see that the function is supposed to be called by the `caller`, but since no validation is added anyone can call the function `onModify` with arbitrary params.

Which then calls `BaseRewarder's OnModify`:

```solidity
function onModify(address account, uint256 pid, uint256 oldBalance, uint256 newBalance, uint256 oldTotalSupply)
        public
        virtual
        override
        returns (uint256)
    {
        if (msg.sender != _caller) revert BaseRewarder__InvalidCaller();
        if (pid != _pid()) revert BaseRewarder__InvalidPid(pid);

        return _update(account, oldBalance, newBalance, oldTotalSupply);
    }
```
The check for msg.sender != caller will pass since the msg.sender will be the `MasterChefRewarder` and then _update is called:

```solidity
function _update(address account, uint256 oldBalance, uint256 newBalance, uint256 oldTotalSupply)
        internal
        virtual
        returns (uint256 rewards)
    {

        uint256 totalUnclaimedRewards = _totalUnclaimedRewards;

        uint256 reserve = _reserve;

        uint256 totalRewards = oldTotalSupply == 0 ? 0 : _rewarder.getTotalRewards(_rewardsPerSecond, _endTimestamp, oldTotalSupply);

        rewards = _rewarder.update(account, oldBalance, newBalance, oldTotalSupply, totalRewards);

        _totalUnclaimedRewards = totalUnclaimedRewards + totalRewards - rewards;

        _reserve = reserve - rewards;
        
    }
```

And here with arbitrary params set by the user calling the function he can decrease\increase rewards and balances for particular user.
