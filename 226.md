# Avoid using constructor in upgradable contracts.

## Summary
See detail.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `Voter.sol` , `MlumStaking.sol` , `MasterchefV2.sol`  and other contracts are upgradable contracts . However due to a requirement of the proxy-based upgradeability system, no constructors can be used in upgradeable contracts and the  initialization logic should be handled via an `initialize` function.

You can check here - [Upgradable contracts](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades-plugins/1.x/writing-upgradeable#:~:text=Due%20to%20a%20requirement%20of,be%20used%20in%20upgradeable%20contracts.)

## Impact
The initialization logic in the constructor may not be executed as expected when the contract is deployed behind a proxy.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Move the logic that is currently in the `constructor` to an `initialize` function. This function should be called explicitly after deploying the contract.
