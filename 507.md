# NFT approved users cannot vote

## Summary

Approved users over `lsNFT` cannot vote via `Voter::vote` due to strict if check.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `MlumStaking.sol`, approved users for a given `lsNFT` can perform any operations, but cannot vote because `Voter::vote` has strict owner check.

```solidity
function vote(uint256 tokenId, address[] calldata pools, uint256[] calldata deltaAmounts) external {
    if (pools.length != deltaAmounts.length) revert IVoter__InvalidLength();

    // check voting started
    if (!_votingStarted()) revert IVoter_VotingPeriodNotStarted();
    if (_votingEnded()) revert IVoter_VotingPeriodEnded();

    // check ownership of tokenId
    if (_mlumStaking.ownerOf(tokenId) != msg.sender) { // AUDIT - approved users cannot vote 
        revert IVoter__NotOwner();
    }
    ....
    
    ...
}
```

## Impact

Approved addresses cannot vote, thus losing the purpose of approving `lsNFTs`, while still being able to perform any other operation in `MlumStaking.sol`.

## Recommendation

Make `MlumStaking::_requireOnlyApprovedOrOwnerOf()` public and use it instead of `ownerOf()`.
