# amountPerPeriod, deltaAmount, and reward calculations should be checked for potential overflow or underflow issues

## Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/rewarders/BribeRewarder.sol#L153

Arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, and multiplication in Solidity can result in overflow or underflow, causing unexpected behavior or potential exploits. Solidity 0.8.0 and later versions include built-in overflow and underflow checks that automatically revert transactions if overflow or underflow occurs.

## Vulnerability Detail

In Solidity, arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, and multiplication can result in overflow or underflow, causing unexpected behavior or potential exploits. Solidity 0.8.0 and later versions include built-in overflow and underflow checks that automatically revert transactions if overflow or underflow occurs. However, itâ€™s important to explicitly mention the importance of these checks to ensure safe arithmetic operations.

## Impact

- Overflow/underflow in the calculation of rewards can lead to incorrect reward allocations.

- Overflow/underflow can cause mismanagement of funds, leading to potential financial losses for users and the contract.

- Attackers can exploit overflow/underflow vulnerabilities to manipulate rewards or deposits.

## Code Snippet

The POC exhibits attempt to cause overflow in arithmetic operations by using large values for amountPerPeriod, deltaAmount, or during reward calculations.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

-  Use built-in Solidity overflow/underflow checks and SafeMath library for older versions.
