# Missing Address Zero Check in SafeTransfer Function of `BaseRewarder` function

## Summary
The `safeTransferTo` function in the `BaseRewarder` contract does not check for the zero address `(address(0))` before attempting to transfer tokens, which could lead to tokens becoming stuck if accidentally sent to the zero address.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `safeTransferTo` function attempts to transfer tokens to a specified account without verifying if the destination address is the zero address (address(0)). This omission means that if tokens are mistakenly sent to the zero address, they cannot be recovered by the contract or the sender.
## Impact
The impact of this vulnerability is that tokens intended for transfer could potentially be lost if the destination address is accidentally set to address(0)
## Code Snippet
this function is used while claiming the rewards 
```solidity 
    function _claim(address account, uint256 amount) internal virtual {
        IERC20 token = _token();

        _safeTransferTo(token, account, amount);

        emit Claim(account, token, amount);
    }

```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a check at the beginning of the `_safeTransferTo` function to revert the transaction if the account parameter is address(0)
