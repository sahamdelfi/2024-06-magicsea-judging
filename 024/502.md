# MlumStaking uses non-upgradeable ReentrancyGuard and storage will be messed in case of upgrade

## Summary

MlumStaking uses `ReentrancyGuard`, but it uses the non-upgradeable one, which will mess up the storage slots in the case of an upgrade.

## Vulnerability Detail

When the contract is supposed to be upgradable, any inherit from OZ must be of the upgradable version, but in this case `MlumStaking` inherits `ReentrancyGuard`, not `ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable`.

```solidity
contract MlumStaking is
    Ownable2StepUpgradeable,
    ReentrancyGuard, // Audit - non Upgradeable
    IMlumStaking,
    ERC721Upgradeable,
    ERC721EnumerableUpgradeable
{
```

## Impact

When the contract is upgraded, the storage will be messed because `ReentrancyGuard._status` will not be in the predefined slot location as in `ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable`. Also, the status will initially be 0.
