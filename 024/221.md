# Storage of MLUMStaking might be corrupted during upgrading

## Summary

Storage of MLUMStaking might be corrupted during upgrading

## Vulnerability Detail

MLUMStaking.sol inherits from Ownable2StepUpgradeable and ERC721EnumerableUpgradeable, which means this contract is meant to be upgradeable in future. It even has a storage gap itself, defined here : https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/42e799446595c542eff9519353d3becc50cdba63/magicsea-staking/src/MlumStaking.sol#L80

Openzeppelin's v5.0 contracts have been used which means that in upgradeable versions of contracts, EIP1967 fixed storage slots are used for storing the "owner", "tokenApprovals" etc. variables.

But MLUMStaking's inheritance order is this :

```solidity

contract MlumStaking is
    Ownable2StepUpgradeable,
    ReentrancyGuard,
    IMlumStaking,
    ERC721Upgradeable,
    ERC721EnumerableUpgradeable
{
```

where ReentrancyGuard is not the upgradeable version and stuffed in between other upgradeable contracts. Without fixed storage slots, adding new storage variables to MLUMStaking, or changing anything in the inheritance hierarchy can potentially collide with the storage layout of the previous contract versions, causing critical misbehaviors in the system.

## Impact

Storage of MLUMStaking.sol might get corrputed during upgradation, as MLUMStaking inherits contracts that are not upgrade-safe.

## Tool used

## Recommendation

Use ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable from Openzeppelin's library, instead of ReentrancyGuard
