# INCORRECT ACCESS CONTROL ON updateAll() function can lead to unlimited minting of lum tokens and abnormal increment of user's rewards

## Summary
`updateAll()` is a privileged function which should not lack access controls. However, with the current implementation, it is a callable by anyone, and it also lacks time-based access restrictions. One critical operation that is performed within this call is the minting of LUM tokens to both the treasury address and the MasterChefV2 contract. Since any user can call it at any time, it implies user can freely mints LUM tokens infinitely. 

## Vulnerability Detail
1. `updateAll()` is an external function that has neither role-based access control nor time-based access control. However, this function too calls the private `_updateAll` function which is responsible for the modification of some of the critical operations in the contract.

2. Inside the private `_updateAll` function, there are some critical operations that modifies some state parameters. This includes:
   + calls to `_mintLum` function
  https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/MasterchefV2.sol#L526

   + calls to `rewarder.updateAccDebtPerShare`
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/MasterchefV2.sol#L528

3. Inside the `_mintLum` function, there's minting of LUM tokens to the treasury address, and the MasterChefV2 contract. Now, this function too has no time-based control either. 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/MasterchefV2.sol#L584-L596

So whenever `_mintLum` function is called, tokens are minted to the treasury address and the MasterChefV2 contract. Malicious user can keep on calling `updateAll` so as to mint unlimited LUM tokens into circulation. 

4. Inside the call to `rewarder.updateAccDebtPerShare`, there's changes that's made to the state variable **rewarder.accDebtPerShare**. This value is incremented whenever this `rewarder.updateAccDebtPerShare` function is called. Now, since a user is able to call this function at will, it implies this value can be incremented significantly to a very high value. See L161 of the code snippet below:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/libraries/Rewarder.sol#L153-L161

5. The issue lies in the fact that this state variable, **rewarder.accDebtPerShare**, which an attacker has absolute control to manipulate, is used in the calculation of users' accumulated rewards across any specified farm. Reward calculation is done through this function:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/MasterchefV2.sol#L549

   + Now, upon analysing that function, it's observed that although the rewards a user is entitled to is decremented by the **reward.debt[user]**, this is only set only after when rewards have been already computed.
 https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/libraries/Rewarder.sol#L140

6. Attacker can keep on increasing the rewarder.accDebtPerShare by calling update multiple times so as to increase his rewards to an extremely high value. 

## Impact

1. The unlimited minting of LUM tokens by anyone may decrease the value of LUM token on other Defi Exchanges.

2. Malicious User receives abnormally high reward tokens than expected, and even can do so from multiple farms.

## Recommendation
The effective recommendation is to restrict the calls to the `updatePool` function to trusted roles only.
If convenient, implement time-based controls too.
