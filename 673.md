# Link should undo unlink

## Summary

Currently, an unlinked contract cannot be linked again and because of the _isStopped variable, that reverts on linking a contract 

## Vulnerability Detail

In the code snippet, we see here https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/rewarders/MasterChefRewarder.sol#L28-L34

the condition `if (_isStopped) revert BaseRewarder__Stopped();` is set and can be set by the function `unlink` on each pid.

The link function if called after the unlik function is called, will always revert which means `onModify` will always revert after unliking and cause DOS for users

## Impact

DOS for users after unblinking with no recourse to relink pool id

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function link(uint256 pid) public override {
        if (msg.sender != _caller) revert BaseRewarder__InvalidCaller();
        if (_status != Status.Unlinked) revert MasterChefRewarder__AlreadyLinked();
        if (pid != _pid()) revert BaseRewarder__InvalidPid(pid);
        if (_isStopped) revert BaseRewarder__Stopped();

        _status = Status.Linked;
    }

    /**
     * @dev Unlinks the rewarder from the MasterChef contract.
     * Can only be called by the caller contract and only once.
     * @param pid The pool ID of the staking pool.
     */
    function unlink(uint256 pid) public override {
        if (msg.sender != _caller) revert BaseRewarder__InvalidCaller();
        if (pid != _pid()) revert BaseRewarder__InvalidPid(pid);
        if (_status != Status.Linked) revert MasterChefRewarder__NotLinked();

        _status = Status.Stopped;
        _isStopped = true;
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add a new function to relink an unlinked pool id or add the logic to the link instead of reverting
