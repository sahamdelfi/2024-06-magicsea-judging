# Users' staked tokens will be used to reward other users when `rewardToken == stakedToken`

## Summary
The protocol wants to support all kinds of ERC20 tokens, and there are restrictions on reward tokens being different from staked tokens. When they are the same, the staking contract will malfunction and reward tokens will be incorrectly disseminated.

## Vulnerability Detail
The crux of this issue lies in how reward calculation is based on the variable `rewardBalance`, which is the balance of reward token in the contract.

```sol
uint256 rewardBalance = rewardToken.balanceOf(address(this));
```

Since both stakedToken and rewardToken shares the same balance, all of users' staked tokens will actually be used in the reward calculation. As a result, the contract will be quickly drained of the original staked tokens (which should not be touched) as users who claim rewards are over compensated.

## Impact
Users who claim rewards earlier on will benefit massively at the cost of other users not even being able to withdraw their principal, as their staked tokens are used to pay as rewards for other users.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider setting on constructor that `stakedToken != rewardToken`.
