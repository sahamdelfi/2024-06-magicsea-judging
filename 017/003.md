# Users cannot withdraw staked assets if reward token and stake token are the same

## Summary

As "Pools are permissionless", it is possible that the stake token and reward token are the same token in a deployed pool. User staked tokens would be distributed as the reward tokens in this case.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `_lastRewardBalance` tracks the reward tokens balance. If the reward token is the same with the stake token,  `_lastRewardBalance` saves reward token balance plus stake token balance. Resulting in staked tokens are accumulated as the reward tokens, and the `accRewardsPerShare` is updated based on total balance increasement, which is significantly larger than intended.

As a result, user staked tokens are distributed as the reward tokens.

## Impact

Some of users cannot withdraw all of their staked tokens as their tokens are distributed as rewards to other stakers.

## Recommendation

Ensure the stake token and reward token cannot be the same in the constructor.
