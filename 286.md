# Audit Report: Integration of Dynamic Month Duration Calculation in `Booster` Smart Contract

## Summary
The proposed integration of the `NextMonthDays` library into the **`Booster`** smart contract aims to replace the static definition of month duration (`SEC_PER_MONTH`) with a dynamic calculation based on the actual number of days in the next calendar month. This enhancement provides users with accurate information regarding the end time of reward periods, aligning with business model requirements for clarity and precision.
## Vulnerability Detail
The current implementation of SEC_PER_MONTH in the Booster smart contract uses a fixed value of 2,628,000 seconds, equating to approximately 30 days. However, this static definition does not account for variations in the number of days per month due to leap years and calendar irregularities. This could lead to discrepancies between the expected and actual end times of reward periods, potentially confusing users and affecting the accuracy of financial projections.

By integrating the NextMonthDays library, the contract dynamically calculates the duration of the next month based on the current timestamp. This approach mitigates the risk of inaccuracies stemming from static month duration assumptions, ensuring that reward end times are reliably aligned with calendar months.
## Impact
**Medium:** The impact of inaccuracies in reward period calculations can lead to user confusion and misaligned expectations regarding the availability of rewards. In financial applications such as staking contracts, where timing precision is crucial, discrepancies in reward period end times could undermine user trust and satisfaction.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To enhance the robustness and usability of the `Booster` smart contract, consider integrating the `NextMonthDays` library as proposed. This integration ensures that reward period end times accurately reflect the actual number of days in the next calendar month, thereby providing users with transparent and predictable reward scheduling. Additionally, document the integration thoroughly to facilitate understanding and maintenance by future developers.
