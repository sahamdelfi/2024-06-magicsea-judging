# _unlockOperators operators are currently DoSed forever

## Summary
The `_unlockOperators` in `MlumStaking.sol` that are allowed to forcibly unlock locked spNFTs can't because the `_withdrawFromPosition()` and `emergencyWithdraw` have checks if they are called by the position owner. So if they are called by the operators they will just revert

## Vulnerability Detail
Here are the modifiers preventing them from being called by the `unlockOperators`:

```solidity
 function emergencyWithdraw(uint256 tokenId) external override nonReentrant {
>>      _requireOnlyOwnerOf(tokenId);

        StakingPosition storage position = _stakingPositions[tokenId];

        
        require(
>>          _unlockOperators.contains(msg.sender) ||
                (position.startLockTime + position.lockDuration) <=
                _currentBlockTimestamp() ||
                isUnlocked(),
            "locked"
        );
```     
It will never go the the require because the operator is not owner of the position. The same happens in the withdraw functions
```solidity
function _withdrawFromPosition(
        address nftOwner,
        uint256 tokenId,
        uint256 amountToWithdraw
    ) internal {
        require(amountToWithdraw > 0, "null");

        StakingPosition storage position = _stakingPositions[tokenId];
        require(
>>          _unlockOperators.contains(nftOwner) ||
                (position.startLockTime + position.lockDuration) <=
                _currentBlockTimestamp() ||
                isUnlocked(),
            "locked"
        );
```
It will never go to this one because in the external `withdrawFromPosition()` there is check if the `msg.sender` is an owner

```solidity
function withdrawFromPosition(
        uint256 tokenId,
        uint256 amountToWithdraw
    ) external nonReentrant {
>>      _requireOnlyApprovedOrOwnerOf(tokenId);

      ...
    }
```

## Impact
High because an implemented functionality in the protocol is not working

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Check if the `msg.sender` is one of the unlock operators and if he is just skip the check about the owner of the nft
