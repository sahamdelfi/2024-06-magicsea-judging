# Tokens with high decimals will DoS the BribeRewarder contract

## Summary

In case tokens with high decimals or cheap tokens are used in `BribeRewarder` rewarder updates will fail most of the time, rendering the contract unable to distribute rewards to anyone.

## Vulnerability Detail

Token with 24 [[decimals](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20?tab=readme-ov-file#high-decimals)](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20?tab=readme-ov-file#high-decimals) used in `BribeRewarder` will DoS the voting mechanism and reward distribution for the pools and period for which are registered:

```solidity
  function onRegister() external override {
      IBribeRewarder rewarder = IBribeRewarder(msg.sender);

      _checkRegisterCaller(rewarder);

      uint256 currentPeriodId = _currentVotingPeriodId;
      (address pool, uint256[] memory periods) = rewarder.getBribePeriods();
      for (uint256 i = 0; i < periods.length; ++i) {

          require(periods[i] >= currentPeriodId, "wrong period");
          require(_bribesPerPriod[periods[i]][pool].length + 1 <= Constants.MAX_BRIBES_PER_POOL, "too much bribes");
          _bribesPerPriod[periods[i]][pool].push(rewarder);
      }
  }
```

The issue lies in the way that the `debtPerShare` is calculated in the `Rewarder` library:

```solidity
function getDebtPerShare(uint256 totalDeposit, uint256 totalRewards) internal pure returns (uint256) {
      return totalDeposit == 0 ? 0 : (totalRewards << Constants.ACC_PRECISION_BITS) / totalDeposit;
  }
```

Due to the bitwise operation performed if totalRewards are 10000e24 for the current period (low priced token) all transactions invoking the `_modify` function will revert and will effectively brick the voting for this pool. 

## Impact

`BribeRewarder` with high decimal token or cheap token with 18 decimals will brick the voting for this pool also disabling the claiming.

## Recommendation

Use different math to handle tokens with big decimals.
