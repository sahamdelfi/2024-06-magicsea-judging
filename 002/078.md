# The `MasterChefV2` contract is not compatible with rebasing tokens leading to funds loss

## Summary
The `MasterChefV2` contract's architecture, while designed to accommodate various ERC20 tokens, introduces critical vulnerabilities when interacting with negatively rebasing tokens, potentially resulting in significant losses for users.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `MasterChefV2` contract aims to support a diverse range of ERC20 tokens, including those with atypical behaviors. This intention is clearly stated in the project documentation:

> he system supports all ERC20 token types. Users have the freedom to create pools for any token, including those with unusual characteristics. Issues arising from such tokens will be considered valid if they pose substantial risks.

To illustrate the vulnerability, let's examine a specific scenario involving a negatively rebasing token:

- A new pool is created in `MasterChefV2` using a token that can rebase negatively.
- 20 users each deposit 8e18 tokens, resulting in a `totalAmounts` of 160e18 in the pool's `Parameter` struct.
- An external event triggers a negative rebase, reducing the actual token balance to 120e18.
- The first 15 users successfully withdraw their 8e18 tokens each (120e18 total).
- The remaining 5 users are left with no tokens to withdraw, despite having initially deposited the same amount as others.
- This discrepancy occurs because the contract's accounting system doesn't dynamically adjust to the token's rebasing mechanism. It continues to use the initial deposit amounts for calculations, even though the actual token balance has decreased.

## Impact
Critical - Users may experience complete loss of their deposited funds, particularly those who attempt to withdraw after a significant negative rebase event.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
To address this vulnerability, consider implementing the following

Develop a blacklist mechanism to prevent the creation of pools using known rebasing tokens.

Implement a share-based system for rebasing token pools, similar to ERC4626 vaults. This approach would allocate shares to users based on their deposits, ensuring fair distribution of the pool's assets regardless of rebasing events.
