# The quantity is calculated incorrectly when depositing Fee on Transfer Tokens.

## Summary
In the current implementation, when users deposit tokens to a farm, the quantity received by the farm is incorrectly calculated for tokens that charge a fee on transfer. This results in a discrepancy between the intended and actual deposited amounts.


As the protocol mentions, pools are permissionless, so users can open pools with fee-on-transfer tokens.


```js
If you are integrating tokens, are you allowing only whitelisted tokens to work with the codebase or any complying with the standard? Are they assumed to have certain properties, e.g. be non-reentrant? Are there any types of weird tokens you want to integrate?

Any type of ERC20 token. Pools are permissionless. So users can open pools even with weird tokens. Issues regarding any weird token will be valid if they have Med/High impact.
```

## Vulnerability Detail


when a user deposits tokens into a farm via the depositOnBehalf and deposit functions, the protocol does not account for this fee. This leads to a mismatch between the `_modify` and actual token amounts received by the farm.


```solidity
    function depositOnBehalf(uint256 pid, uint256 amount, address to) external override onlyTrusted {
        _modify(pid, to, amount.toInt256(), false);

        if (amount > 0) _farms[pid].token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
    }

    function deposit(uint256 pid, uint256 amount) external override {
        _modify(pid, msg.sender, amount.toInt256(), false);

        if (amount > 0) _farms[pid].token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
    }
```

In both functions, the contract assumes that the full amount specified in the safeTransferFrom call will be transferred to the farm. However, for tokens with a transfer fee, the actual amount received is less, leading to incorrect accounting.


## Impact

Some tokens charge a fee on transfer, causing the `_modify` function to calculate less than the specified amount. Thus, the farm's token balance might not accurately reflect the actual holdings.

## Recommendation

Use before and after balance to accurately reflect the true amount received, and `_modify` that amount accordingly.
