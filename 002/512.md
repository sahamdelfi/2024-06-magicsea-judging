# MasterchefV2 doesnâ€™t handle fee-on-transfer tokens

## Summary

Protocol intends to support all types of farms, including ones with fee-on-transfer tokens, but there is a lack of functionality to handle the fees and as a result, the accounting will be wrong.

## Vulnerability Detail

Looking at the `MasterchefV2::deposit` we will see that there is a normal `safeTransferFrom` executed:

```solidity
function deposit(uint256 pid, uint256 amount) external override {
      _modify(pid, msg.sender, amount.toInt256(), false);

      if (amount > 0) _farms[pid].token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
  }
```

Instead of the approach used in `MlumStaking` contract to take the balance of the token before/after the transfer, which will give the net amount transferred. In case there is a farm using FOT token, the most simple issue that will occur is that emergency withdrawal will fail as it uses the **amount** that is saved in the mapping, not the actual token balance of the user. 

## Impact

Functionality will be dossed in case fee-on-transfer tokens are being used

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use the `_transferSupportingFeeOnTransfer` function from `MlumStaking`:

```solidity
  function _transferSupportingFeeOnTransfer(IERC20 token, address user, uint256 amount)
      internal
      returns (uint256 receivedAmount)
  {
      uint256 previousBalance = token.balanceOf(address(this));
      token.safeTransferFrom(user, address(this), amount);
      return token.balanceOf(address(this)) - previousBalance;
  }
```
