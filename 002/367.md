# MasterchefV2 does not account for fee on transfer tokens, causing innacurate acounting and possible stealing of funds

## Summary

If a farm is registered with a fee on transfer token. The `MasterChefV2.sol` contract will not account for amounts correctly, which can cause stealing of funds.

## Vulnerability Detail

The initial function to deposit funds into any farm within the `MasterChefV2.sol` contract is its `deposit` function

```solidity
    function deposit(uint256 pid, uint256 amount) external override {
        _modify(pid, msg.sender, amount.toInt256(), false);

        if (amount > 0)
            _farms[pid].token.safeTransferFrom(
                msg.sender,
                address(this),
                amount
            );
    }
```

It does the following:

1. Calling `_modify` which updates user balances with the provided amount and updates the user's rewards.
2. Transfers the tokens from the user, if the amount provided is > 0.

because it accounts for the whole amount transfered and not the amount actually received by the contract , it will create problems for fee on transfer tokens.

## Proof of Concept

A way for a user to exploit this is:
  1. Bob calls deposit with `amount=100e18`
  2. Within `_modify()` Bob's amounts are updated with the amount provided (100e18).
  3. When the contract transfers the tokens from Bob, because of the fee the contract actually receives 97e18 tokens. 

  4. Alice comes in does the same things Bob did from step 1 to 3.
     - Now the balance of the contract is `97e18 + 97e18 = 194e18`
  5. Bob sees that alice deposited and calls `MasterChefV2.sol::withdraw` with `amount=100e18`.
  6. The contract sends 100e18 tokens to Bob leaving 94e18 in balance left.
  7. Alice tries calling `MasterChefV2.sol::withdraw` with `amount=100e18`, but her transaction reverts due to the contract's insufficient balance.

## Impact

Stealing of funds from other users.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider adding a helper function to handle FoT tokens.

```solidity
    function _transferSupportingFeeOnTransfer(
        IERC20 token,
        address user,
        uint256 amount
    ) internal returns (uint256 receivedAmount) {
        uint256 previousBalance = token.balanceOf(address(this));
        token.safeTransferFrom(user, address(this), amount);
        return token.balanceOf(address(this)) - previousBalance;
    }
```

```diff
    function deposit(uint256 pid, uint256 amount) external override {
+       uint256 amountToAdd = _transferSupportingFeeOnTransfer(_farms[pid].token, msg.sender, amount);
-        _modify(pid, msg.sender, amount.toInt256(), false);
+        _modify(pid, msg.sender, amountToAdd.toInt256(), false);
-        if (amount > 0)
-           _farms[pid].token.safeTransferFrom(
-               msg.sender,
-               address(this),
-               amount
            );
    }

```
