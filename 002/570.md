# MasterChef is not compatible with rebasing tokens

## Summary
Rebasing tokens are tokens that have each holder's `balanceof()` increase over time. Aave aTokens are an example of such tokens. While `MasterChef` uses store state variables for all the computation and ignore all the accrued rewards   

## Vulnerability Detail
Taking the example of emergency withdraw, First it fetch the stored balance from state variables and transfer the same amount to calller, leaving all the rebased accrued rewards
```solidity
    function emergencyWithdraw(uint256 pid) external override {
        Farm storage farm = _farms[pid];

        uint256 balance = farm.amounts.getAmountOf(msg.sender);
        int256 deltaAmount = -balance.toInt256();

        farm.amounts.update(msg.sender, deltaAmount);

        farm.token.safeTransfer(msg.sender, balance);

        emit PositionModified(pid, msg.sender, deltaAmount, 0);
    }

```
The amount actually available grows over time which should be distributed proportionally to the deposited tokens .
## Impact
If rebasing tokens are used as the MasterChef, rewards accrues to the contract but cann't withdrawn by user.
