# MasterChefV2 doesn't account for fee on transfer tokens on deposits

## Summary

In `MasterChefV2::deposit` & `MasterChefV2::depositOnBehalfOf` the token amount is used to modify the users balance before the token is transferred.
in cases where the token is a fee on transfer token the token amount recieved by the contract will be less than what was added to the users balance

## Vulnerability Detail

In `MasterChefV2::deposit` & `MasterChefV2::depositOnBehalfOf` the token amount is used to modify the users balance before the token is transferred.
As seen [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/MasterchefV2.sol#L284-L299) the `_modify` function is called before the token is transferred, which means if the token is a fee on trans fer token then the contract actually recieves less tokens than expected.

## Impact

There will be less tokens in the contract than accounted for ,which means some users may not be able to completely withdraw their tokens

## Recommendation

```diff

 function deposit(uint256 pid, uint256 amount) external override {
+       uint balance = _farms[pid].token.balanceOf(address(this));
+       _farms[pid].token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
+       amount = _farms[pid].token.balanceOf(address(this)) - balance;

        _modify(pid, msg.sender, amount.toInt256(), false);

-       if (amount > 0) _farms[pid].token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
 }
```
same for `depositOnBehalfOf`
