# MasterChefV2.sol and bribeRewarder.sol will have accounting issues with Fee-On-Transfer Tokens

## Summary
Wrong accounting for fee-on-transfer tokens

## Vulnerability Detail
Lets follow the code flow for `MasterChefV2.deposit()` 
```solidity
function deposit(uint256 pid, uint256 amount) external override {
        _modify(pid, msg.sender, amount.toInt256(), false);

        if (amount > 0) _farms[pid].token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
    }

```

`_modify()` is called with deposit amount converted to int256.

```solidity
function _modify(uint256 pid, address account, int256 deltaAmount, bool isPayOutReward) private {
'''extra code        

        (uint256 oldBalance, uint256 newBalance, uint256 oldTotalSupply,) = farm.amounts.update(account, deltaAmount);

'''extra code
```

Now in `_modify()`, `amounts.update()` is called with deposit amount as deltaAmount and used to carryOut accounting for account

```solidity
 function update(Parameter storage amounts, bytes32 key, int256 deltaAmount)
        internal
        returns (uint256 oldAmount, uint256 newAmount, uint256 oldTotalAmount, uint256 newTotalAmount)
    {
        oldAmount = amounts.amounts[key];
        oldTotalAmount = amounts.totalAmount;

        if (deltaAmount == 0) {
            newAmount = oldAmount;
            newTotalAmount = oldTotalAmount;
        } else {
            newAmount = oldAmount.addDelta(deltaAmount);//@audit doesn't consider fee-on-transfer tokens
            newTotalAmount = oldTotalAmount.addDelta(deltaAmount);

            amounts.amounts[key] = newAmount;
            amounts.totalAmount = newTotalAmount;
        }
    }
```

The issue here is that specified deposit amount may not be what the contract receives during deposits for tokens that charge fees on transfers.

## Impact

## Recommendation

take note of balance before and after the deposit, then use their difference to account for deposits.
