# Fee-on-transfer tokens will cause insolvency in MastercherV2

## Summary
In MastechefV2 fees on fee-on-transfer tokens have not been considered. As a result users will not be able to withdraw their full amount.
## Vulnerability Detail
The deposit function in MastechefV2 modifies the amount and totalSupply with the amount passed in the function.
```solidity
 function deposit(uint256 pid, uint256 amount) external override {
        _modify(pid, msg.sender, amount.toInt256(), false);

        if (amount > 0) _farms[pid].token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);//@audit will not work for fee on transfer tokens
    }
```
 After the _modify is executed, the tokens are transfered from the sender to the contract. However when a fee-on-transfer token is used the state updates of the user's amount and the totalSupply will be incorrect because the fee was not considered.
```solidity
(uint256 oldBalance, uint256 newBalance, uint256 oldTotalSupply,) = farm.amounts.update(account, deltaAmount);
```
 The following is stated in the readMe:
`Any type of ERC20 token. Pools are permissionless. So users can open pools even with weird tokens. Issues regarding any weird token will be valid if they have Med/High impact.`
This will result in protocol insolvency at some point because the amount recorded will be always more than the actual balance of the contract.
## Impact
Protocol insolvency - High.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Copy and use the function from `MlumStaking.sol` - `_transferSupportingFeeOnTransfer` to track the actual amount.
