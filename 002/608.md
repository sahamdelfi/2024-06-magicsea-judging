# No revert on failure tokens can be deposited without adding funds and can be stolen by the user

## Summary
No revert on failure ERC20 tokens can be deposited without adding funds because of wrong sequence design.
## Vulnerability Detail
No revert on failure ERC20 tokens don't revert when it occur an error, instead it return bool value. This situation is problematic. (see: https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20#user-content-no-revert-on-failure) 
(see: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea?tab=readme-ov-file#q-if-you-are-integrating-tokens-are-you-allowing-only-whitelisted-tokens-to-work-with-the-codebase-or-any-complying-with-the-standard-are-they-assumed-to-have-certain-properties-eg-be-non-reentrant-are-there-any-types-of-weird-tokens-you-want-to-integrate)
## Impact
User can deposit any amounts of funds while sending fool parameters successfully then user can steal all the money
## Code Snippet
Following function is used for depositing to farming pool:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/42e799446595c542eff9519353d3becc50cdba63/magicsea-staking/src/MasterchefV2.sol#L295C1-L299C6
```solidity
    function deposit(uint256 pid, uint256 amount) external override {
        _modify(pid, msg.sender, amount.toInt256(), false);

        if (amount > 0) _farms[pid].token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
    }
```
## Proof of Concept

Let say, we have a no revert on failure token like ZRX in farming pool and Alice has no ZRX token. She can deposit any amounts of funds without actually sending it. Let's check from the code:
```solidity
_modify(pid, msg.sender, amount.toInt256(), false);
```
Function starts with that line, which makes calculations and changes storage variables based on the parameters given by user. Then:
```solidity
if (amount > 0) _farms[pid].token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
```
This line perform safeTransferFrom() action. No revert on failure tokens won't revert the transaction but transfer is failed. So, Alice started to farm without sending any funds to contract and now she can steal all the ZRX with .withdraw() function.

## Recommendation

For best approach, checking the difference between the executions will solve the problem. Checking bool value is not good approach because the other ERC20 types doesn't return a bool value.

```console

         if (amount > 0) _farms[pid].token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
+        amount = _farms[pid].token.balanceOf(address(this)) - balanceOfThis;

+        _modify(pid, msg.sender, amount.toInt256(), false);
     }
