# Wierd Tokens Are Not Supported Disrupting Contract Functionality

## Summary

As stated by the sponsor on the contest rules: *Any type of ERC20 token. Pools are permissionless. So users can open pools even with weird tokens. Issues regarding any weird token will be valid if they have Med/High impact.*

The `MasterChefRewarder` contract do not support weird tokens. This can lead to improper fund distribution and even lock of funds on the contracts.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `MasterChef` contract follow the next approach to store deposited tokens and to distribute them. This is, taking the user input supplied amount as parameter using it for [accounting](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/MasterchefV2.sol#L296C9-L296C16). Then [transfer](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/MasterchefV2.sol#L298) the corresponding token amount. However if for example, fee on transfer token is used the amount accounted will be wrong as the contract receives less tokens than what the amount indicated.

So rewards for the `MasterChefRewarder` would be always calculated with a bigger amount than what it should and the last user on claiming on `emergencyWithdraw` will always be unable to recover its tokens as the contract will not have the adequate balance to transfer it.

## Impact

Improper fund distribution, funds locked and abnormal contracts functionality.

## Code Snippet

[Deposit and withdraw functions](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/MasterchefV2.sol#L295-L337)
```solidity
  function deposit(uint256 pid, uint256 amount) external override {
      _modify(pid, msg.sender, amount.toInt256(), false);

      if (amount > 0) _farms[pid].token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
  }

  /**
   * @dev Withdraws tokens from a farm.
   * @param pid The pool ID of the farm.
   * @param amount The amount of tokens to withdraw.
   */
  function withdraw(uint256 pid, uint256 amount) external override {
      _modify(pid, msg.sender, -amount.toInt256(), true);

      if (amount > 0) _farms[pid].token.safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);
  }

  /**
   * @dev Claims the rewards from a list of farms.
   * @param pids The pool IDs of the farms.
   */
  function claim(uint256[] calldata pids) external override {
      for (uint256 i; i < pids.length; ++i) {
          _modify(pids[i], msg.sender, 0, true);
      }
  }

  /**
   * @dev Emergency withdraws tokens from a farm, without claiming any rewards.
   * @param pid The pool ID of the farm.
   */
  function emergencyWithdraw(uint256 pid) external override {
      Farm storage farm = _farms[pid];

      uint256 balance = farm.amounts.getAmountOf(msg.sender);
      int256 deltaAmount = -balance.toInt256();

      farm.amounts.update(msg.sender, deltaAmount);

      farm.token.safeTransfer(msg.sender, balance);

      emit PositionModified(pid, msg.sender, deltaAmount, 0);
  }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

For deposits, first transfer the tokens and then count for the increased balance. Use that for storing users balance instead of input supplied parameters. It is also advised to do this for `BribeRewarder` and `MasterChefRewarder`. Although there is not a significant impact they do not comply perfectly with weird tokens. Consider using Compound library.
