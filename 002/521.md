# Down Rebasing Tokens will cause bankrun in MlumStaking and MasterChefV2

## Summary

Down rebasing tokens lower the balance of all token holders, when a rebase accrues. 

Because MasterChef as well as MlumStaking both track the internal balance in storage, it will lead to a scenario in which the internal balance records an higher number of tokens than there actually are in the contract.

In case this happens users will rush to withdraw, because the last one to withdraw loses all there tokens.
This will instantly drain all liquidity from staking.

Based on README protocol team intends to support weird tokens as stake tokens in both contracts.

## Vulnerability Detail
Inside of MlumStaking we can see that on withdraw the amountToWithdraw is directly taken from the user input.
It fails to scale this in case the contract balance has changed because of rebase. 

```solidity
    function _withdrawFromPosition(address nftOwner, uint256 tokenId, uint256 amountToWithdraw) internal {
       ....
        stakedToken.safeTransfer(nftOwner, amountToWithdraw);
    }
```
We can observe similar behavior on MasterChefV2.

## Impact

Bankrun of staking contracts will leave last user to withdraw in a loss.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The total deposits should be checked against contract balance, and in case there are changes should be scaled accordingly.
