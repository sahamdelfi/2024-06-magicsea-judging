# Protocol is incompatible with rebasing/"balance changing outside transfer" tokens


## Summary

See _Title_.

## Vulnerability Detail

As hinted from the title, protocol is not compatible with tokens that charge their balance outside transfers/ rebasing tokens.

First see https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/42e799446595c542eff9519353d3be0cc50cdba63/magicsea-staking/src/MasterchefV2.sol#L284-L320)

```solidity
    function depositOnBehalf(uint256 pid, uint256 amount, address to) external override onlyTrusted {
        _modify(pid, to, amount.toInt256(), false);

        if (amount > 0) _farms[pid].token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
    }

    function deposit(uint256 pid, uint256 amount) external override {
        _modify(pid, msg.sender, amount.toInt256(), false);

        if (amount > 0) _farms[pid].token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
    }


    function withdraw(uint256 pid, uint256 amount) external override {
        _modify(pid, msg.sender, -amount.toInt256(), true);

        if (amount > 0) _farms[pid].token.safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);
    }

    function claim(uint256[] calldata pids) external override {
        for (uint256 i; i < pids.length; ++i) {
            _modify(pids[i], msg.sender, 0, true);
        }
    }
```

All the functions above end up making a call to the MasterChefV2's native `_modify()`.

Bug window however is that in some instances the `isPayOutReward` bool is not always set to `true` and int he case where it's `false` the assets get stored instead.

Now from the snippets above we can see that there is a classic logic where one can deposit and withdraw.

Going to the implementation of `_modify()` however https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/42e799446595c542eff9519353d3becc50cdba63/magicsea-staking/src/MasterchefV2.sol#L538-L564

```solidity

    function _modify(uint256 pid, address account, int256 deltaAmount, bool isPayOutReward) private {
        Farm storage farm = _farms[pid];
        Rewarder.Parameter storage rewarder = farm.rewarder;
        IMasterChefRewarder extraRewarder = farm.extraRewarder;

        (uint256 oldBalance, uint256 newBalance, uint256 oldTotalSupply,) = farm.amounts.update(account, deltaAmount);

        uint256 totalLumRewardForPid = _getRewardForPid(rewarder, pid, oldTotalSupply);
        uint256 lumRewardForPid = _mintLum(totalLumRewardForPid);

        uint256 lumReward = rewarder.update(account, oldBalance, newBalance, oldTotalSupply, lumRewardForPid);

        if (isPayOutReward) {
            lumReward = lumReward + unclaimedRewards[pid][account];
            unclaimedRewards[pid][account] = 0;
            if (lumReward > 0) _lum.safeTransfer(account, lumReward);
        } else {
            unclaimedRewards[pid][account] += lumReward;
        }

        if (address(extraRewarder) != address(0)) {
            extraRewarder.onModify(account, pid, oldBalance, newBalance, oldTotalSupply);
        }

        emit PositionModified(pid, account, deltaAmount, lumReward);
    }
```

We can see that if the `isPayOutReward` bool is set to true, the amount that gets transferred to the `account` is the current `lumReward` and then what's been stored in ` unclaimedRewards[pid][account]`, problem however is that in the case where the token is a rebasing token for as long as ` unclaimedRewards[pid][account]` has been existing for a user the real value might have dropped due to negative rebases, or increased due to positive rebases.

_Hypothetics_

That's to say imagine 5 integrators, all have 20 `stETH` as unclaimed rewards i.e 100 steth overall.
A heavy negative rebase occurs, dropping the overall eth to 70 steth.
A user who actively tracks this can then come to withdraw their unclaimed rewards and the _MasterChef_ contract would still send them 20 eth, instead of `(70/100) * 20`, which then means that the user has stolen tokens from other users.
Similarly if there is a positive rebase, this means that users that come to withdraw their tokens would lose out on their tokens, cause the +ve rebase is not being counted in.

## Impact

As hinted under _vulnerability details,_ protocol is incompatible with rebasing/balance changing out of transfer tokens in multiple instances which would directly lead to other users stealing tokens from others and then the last set of users would not be able to withdraw, or direct loss of funds for users in the case of a +ve rebase.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Do not support these tokens, or introduce a functionality to track the rebase that occurred before a user claimed their rewards.

In the case of some popular rebasing tokens like steth then the wrapped version can be used to curb this.
