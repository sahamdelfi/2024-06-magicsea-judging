# Rebasing tokens are not supported

## Summary
Rebasing tokens are not compatible with `BribeRewarder`, `BaseRewarder` (& by extension, `MasterChefRewarder`).

## Vulnerability Detail
As per [the README](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#q-if-you-are-integrating-tokens-are-you-allowing-only-whitelisted-tokens-to-work-with-the-codebase-or-any-complying-with-the-standard-are-they-assumed-to-have-certain-properties-eg-be-non-reentrant-are-there-any-types-of-weird-tokens-you-want-to-integrate):
>  users can open pools even with weird tokens. Issues regarding any weird token will be valid if they have Med/High impact.

However, the pools will not work for rebasing tokens (eg. mechanics like `stETH` and `aTokens`) that may rebase up or downwards, where balance changes over time. 

For instance, `BribeRewarder` assumes that whatever is deposited as bribes will be the full reward distribution amount. However, should a positive rebase event occur, it would lead to loss of rewards (as there isn't sweep functionality present in `BribeRewarder`). Conversely, negative rebases would cause reward claims to revert (at least for the last claimant) as there isn't sufficient balance.

## Impact
Functionality failure.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
If rebasing tokens are meant to be supported, then `MlumStaking`'s token transfer and reward mechanism seem to support both FoT and rebasing tokens, eg. `_transferSupportingFeeOnTransfer` and `_safeRewardTransfer()`.
