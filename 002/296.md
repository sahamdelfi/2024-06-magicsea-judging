# There is a high probability that if a user uses tokens with higher decimals and deposits a large value, he will lose a large part of them

## Summary

There is a high probability that if a user uses tokens with higher decimals and deposits a large value, he will lose a large part of them. 

## Vulnerability Detail

If we want to deposit tokens into a random farm, we will use the `deposit()` function:
```solidity
    function deposit(uint256 pid, uint256 amount) external override {
        _modify(pid, msg.sender, amount.toInt256(), false); 

        if (amount > 0) _farms[pid].token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
    }
```

We see that the protocol will use tokens with many decimals:

> Any type of ERC20 token. Pools are permissionless. So users can open pools even with weird tokens.

The problem is that if a user decides to deposit a large value above `Int256`, then the tokens to be deposited will be cut to `Int256`.
```solidity
_modify(pid, msg.sender, amount.toInt256(), false);
```
But he will actually send `uint256 amount`:

```solidity
_farms[pid].token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
```

So, anything above the `int265` value will be a loss for the user.

This vulnerability is possible with tokens with higher decimals and standard tokens if a user decides to deposit a significant amount.
## Impact

If an unsuspecting user decides to deposit a large amount of tokens, he can lose a large portion of them.

## Recommendation

You can change the `amount` augment of the `deposit()` function from  `uint256 amount` to `int256 amount`.
