# `MasterchefV2::deposit` doesn't account for feeOnTransfer tokens

## Summary
`MasterchevV2::deposit` doesn't account for feeOnTransfer tokens which leads to inaccurate calculation of the user's and contract's balance and losses on the contract's side
## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
    /**
     * @dev Deposits tokens to a farm on behalf for user
     * @param pid The pool ID of the farm.
     * @param amount The amount of tokens to deposit.
     * @param to User account
     */
    function depositOnBehalf(uint256 pid, uint256 amount, address to) external override onlyTrusted {
        _modify(pid, to, amount.toInt256(), false);

        if (amount > 0) _farms[pid].token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
    }

    /**
     * @dev Deposits tokens to a farm.
     * @param pid The pool ID of the farm.
     * @param amount The amount of tokens to deposit.
     */
    function deposit(uint256 pid, uint256 amount) external override {
        _modify(pid, msg.sender, amount.toInt256(), false);

        if (amount > 0) _farms[pid].token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
    }
```
Both `depositOnBehalf` and `deposit` update the balances using the value the user has passed as `amount` instead of the actual amount recieved. That means the user's balance will be higher than what they actually own. Because of that any time a user withdraws their funds the contract will incur losses as it will be returning more than it has received.

## Impact
Continuous losses for the contract and eventually reaching the point where users will not be able to withdraw their funds because the contract is empty but their balance is >0

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Calculate the amount received like in `MlumStaking.sol`

```solidity
    /**
     * @dev Handle deposits of tokens with transfer tax
     */
    function _transferSupportingFeeOnTransfer(IERC20 token, address user, uint256 amount)
        internal
        returns (uint256 receivedAmount)
    {
        uint256 previousBalance = token.balanceOf(address(this));
        token.safeTransferFrom(user, address(this), amount);
        return token.balanceOf(address(this)) - previousBalance;
    }
```
