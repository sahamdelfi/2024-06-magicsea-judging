# `MasterChefRewarder` contract cannot support rebasing token as token to be distributed as rewards

## Summary
Although this protocol intends to support any type of ERC20 token, using a rebasing token as the token to be distributed as rewards for the `MasterChefRewarder` contract is problematic for transferring amounts of such token from the `MasterChefRewarder` contract after such token's rebasing event is triggered.

## Vulnerability Detail
According to the [contest Q&A](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#q-if-you-are-integrating-tokens-are-you-allowing-only-whitelisted-tokens-to-work-with-the-codebase-or-any-complying-with-the-standard-are-they-assumed-to-have-certain-properties-eg-be-non-reentrant-are-there-any-types-of-weird-tokens-you-want-to-integrate), `Any type of ERC20 token` needs to be supported by the codebase. For the `MasterChefRewarder` contract, when a rebasing token is used as the token to be distributed as rewards, the state variables for calculating rewards, such as `_totalUnclaimedRewards`, `rewarder.accDebtPerShare`, and `_rewardsPerSecond`, would not be changed by such token's rebasing events but the `MasterChefRewarder` contract's balance of such token would. After such token's rebasing event is triggered, the state variables for calculating rewards and the `MasterChefRewarder` contract's balance of such token would be out of sync, which is problematic for transferring amounts of such token from the `MasterChefRewarder` contract.

## Impact
For example, after such token's deflationary event is triggered, the reward amount to be claimed through the `MasterChefRewarder.onModify` function is not deflated by such deflationary event but the `MasterChefRewarder` contract's balance of such token has been deflated accordingly; when the `BaseRewarder._claim` function is called, claiming the reward amount, which is not deflated, from the `MasterChefRewarder` contract's balance of such token, which has been deflated, would cause the reward portion of the `MasterChefRewarder` contract's balance of such token to be higher than what it should be. As a result, the account that claims such reward amount actually receives some of the rewards that he is not entitled to and should belong to other accounts.

```solidity

        public
        override(BaseRewarder, IBaseRewarder)
        returns (uint256 reward)
    {
        if (_status != Status.Linked) revert MasterChefRewarder__NotLinked();

        reward = BaseRewarder.onModify(account, pid, oldBalance, newBalance, oldTotalSupply);

        _claim(account, reward);
    }

        uint256 totalRewards =
            oldTotalSupply == 0 ? 0 : _rewarder.getTotalRewards(_rewardsPerSecond, _endTimestamp, oldTotalSupply);
        rewards = _rewarder.update(account, oldBalance, newBalance, oldTotalSupply, totalRewards);

        _totalUnclaimedRewards = totalUnclaimedRewards + totalRewards - rewards;
        _reserve = reserve - rewards;

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Like many other protocols, this protocol can consider to not support rebasing tokens. If this protocol wants to support these tokens, it needs to communicate with its users about the shortcomings of these tokens in this protocol.
