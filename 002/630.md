# Attacker can withdraw all tokens deposited in a farm

## Summary
Attacker can withdraw all tokens deposited in a farm

## Vulnerability Detail
There is a bug in the `Math.sol` library in the `addDelta()` function:
```solidity
    function addDelta(uint256 x, int256 delta) internal pure returns (uint256 y) {
        uint256 success;

        assembly {
            y := add(x, delta)

            success := iszero(or(gt(x, MAX_INT256), gt(y, MAX_INT256)))
        }

        if (success == 0) revert Math__UnderOverflow();
    }
```
The issue here is that the line `y := add(x, delta)` will not revert on underflow. If for example `x = 10` and `delta = -20`  the result will be `UINT_MAX - 10`. You might think this won't happen because we are using solidity version 0.8 which has overflow and underflow protection but that is not the case for assembly operations.

An attacker can use this bug to drain all of the deposited tokens in `MasterchefV2.sol` using the `withdraw()` function:
```solidity
    function withdraw(uint256 pid, uint256 amount) external override {
        _modify(pid, msg.sender, -amount.toInt256(), true);

        if (amount > 0) _farms[pid].token.safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);
    }
```
It calls `_modify()` so let's take a look at it:
```solidity
    function _modify(uint256 pid, address account, int256 deltaAmount, bool isPayOutReward) private {
        Farm storage farm = _farms[pid];
        Rewarder.Parameter storage rewarder = farm.rewarder;
        IMasterChefRewarder extraRewarder = farm.extraRewarder;

        (uint256 oldBalance, uint256 newBalance, uint256 oldTotalSupply,) = farm.amounts.update(account, deltaAmount);

        uint256 totalLumRewardForPid = _getRewardForPid(rewarder, pid, oldTotalSupply);
        uint256 lumRewardForPid = _mintLum(totalLumRewardForPid);

        uint256 lumReward = rewarder.update(account, oldBalance, newBalance, oldTotalSupply, lumRewardForPid);

        if (isPayOutReward) {
            lumReward = lumReward + unclaimedRewards[pid][account];
            unclaimedRewards[pid][account] = 0;
            if (lumReward > 0) _lum.safeTransfer(account, lumReward);
        } else {
            unclaimedRewards[pid][account] += lumReward;
        }

        if (address(extraRewarder) != address(0)) {
            extraRewarder.onModify(account, pid, oldBalance, newBalance, oldTotalSupply);
        }

        emit PositionModified(pid, account, deltaAmount, lumReward);
    }
```
As you can see it uses the amounts library to update the balance of the caller:
```solidity
    function update(Parameter storage amounts, bytes32 key, int256 deltaAmount)
        internal
        returns (uint256 oldAmount, uint256 newAmount, uint256 oldTotalAmount, uint256 newTotalAmount)
    {
        oldAmount = amounts.amounts[key];
        oldTotalAmount = amounts.totalAmount;

        if (deltaAmount == 0) {
            newAmount = oldAmount;
            newTotalAmount = oldTotalAmount;
        } else {
            newAmount = oldAmount.addDelta(deltaAmount);
            newTotalAmount = oldTotalAmount.addDelta(deltaAmount);

            amounts.amounts[key] = newAmount;
            amounts.totalAmount = newTotalAmount;
        }
    }
```
Here is where the problematic `addDelta()` function from the `Math.sol` library is used.

What an attacker can do is to enter an `amount` of tokens to withdraw in `withdraw()` that is bigger than the balance he has. There is no check to validate if he is withdrawing more than he has in his balance. Perhaps the intention was that if he tries to do that then this line will simply revert because of an underflow:
```solidity
     newAmount = oldAmount.addDelta(deltaAmount);
```
However as I explained above a revert in `addDelta()` will not happen. The `Amounts.sol` library will simply use this underflowed new balance of the user to calculate how much rewards he should get:
```solidity
     uint256 lumReward = rewarder.update(account, oldBalance, newBalance, oldTotalSupply, lumRewardForPid);
```
After that the function will simply transfer both the calculated reward and the specified tokens to withdraw:
```solidity
        if (isPayOutReward) {
            lumReward = lumReward + unclaimedRewards[pid][account];
            unclaimedRewards[pid][account] = 0;
            if (lumReward > 0) _lum.safeTransfer(account, lumReward);
        } else {
            unclaimedRewards[pid][account] += lumReward;
        }
```

```solidity
if (amount > 0) _farms[pid].token.safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);
```

## Impact
Attacker can drain every deposited token from a farm. He will also get additional rewards that will be calculated incorrectly.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
You can use this implementation for `addDelta()` that is from uniswap:
```solidity
    function addDelta(uint128 x, int128 y) internal pure returns (uint128 z) {
        if (y < 0) {
            require((z = x - uint128(-y)) < x, 'LS');
        } else {
            require((z = x + uint128(y)) >= x, 'LA');
        }
    }
```
Also do a check in the withdraw function that the user is not withdrawing more than he has in his balance:
```diff
    function withdraw(uint256 pid, uint256 amount) external override {
        _modify(pid, msg.sender, -amount.toInt256(), true);

+       if (amount > _farms[pid].amounts.getAmountOf(msg.sender)) revert MasterChef__NotEnoughBalance();
        if (amount > 0) _farms[pid].token.safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);
    }
```
