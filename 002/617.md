# Wrong execution for fee on transfer ERC20 tokens

## Summary
Deposit function is misimplemented and it doesn't support fee on transfer ERC20 tokens (see: https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20#user-content-fee-on-transfer)
## Vulnerability Detail
Some ERC20 tokens use fee on transfer implementation. It basicly takes fee while the transfer operation from the sender. Deposit function in MasterChef contract is misimplemented for this kind of tokens. (see: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea#q-if-you-are-integrating-tokens-are-you-allowing-only-whitelisted-tokens-to-work-with-the-codebase-or-any-complying-with-the-standard-are-they-assumed-to-have-certain-properties-eg-be-non-reentrant-are-there-any-types-of-weird-tokens-you-want-to-integrate)
## Impact
Token holders which use farming pools can lose funds
## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/42e799446595c542eff9519353d3becc50cdba63/magicsea-staking/src/MasterchefV2.sol#L295C1-L299C6
```solidity
    function deposit(uint256 pid, uint256 amount) external override {
        _modify(pid, msg.sender, amount.toInt256(), false);

        if (amount > 0) _farms[pid].token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
    }
```
## Proof of Concept

Let say Alice and Bob have 10 STA tokens and they deposited their funds to farming pool and let say fee value is 1 STA. So, both of them deposited 9 + 9 = 18 total STA tokens. But in storage variables amount is executed as 10 + 10 = 20 because of this implementation logic:
```solidity
    function deposit(uint256 pid, uint256 amount) external override {
        _modify(pid, msg.sender, amount.toInt256(), false);

        if (amount > 0) _farms[pid].token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
    }
```
Then, Bob wants to withdraw his money and he called .withdraw() function:
```solidity
    function withdraw(uint256 pid, uint256 amount) external override {
        _modify(pid, msg.sender, -amount.toInt256(), true);

        if (amount > 0) _farms[pid].token.safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);
    }
```
Now Bob's funds stored as 10 STA at the contract and it try to withdraw 10 STA to Bob. 18 - 10 = 8 STA tokens left in contract for Alice and if she wants to withdraw it, she will get 7 STA token.

In normal execution flow, Alice deposits 9 STA including fee and withdraws 8 STA including fee again. So, normally Alice should get 8 STA instead of 7.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
This implementation logic will solve the problem. It first checks the amounts transferred by the user and then it updates the storage variables. 

Note: It needs to be careful for reentrancy attacks after modifying
