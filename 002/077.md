# Pools should be compatible with weird `ERC20` behaviours, `MasterChefV2` is incompatibile with Rebasing tokens leading to bad consequences.

## Summary

Due to the fact that Pools should be compatible with weird `ERC20` behaviours, `MasterChefV2` is incompatibile with Rebasing tokens leading to bad consequences.

## Vulnerability Detail
The problem arises from the fact that `MasterChefV2` should be compatible with any weird `ERC20` Tokens according to the readMe Quoted here 
> Any type of ERC20 token. Pools are permissionless. So users can open pools even with weird tokens. Issues regarding any weird token will be valid if they have Med/High impact.

To describe the vulnerability i will give an example 

- A new Pool is added in `MasterChefV2` 
- the Pool has rebasing token that rebase positively and negatively according to external situation
- 10 Users `deposit` 10e18 each and the Pool now has 100e18 in `totalAmounts` variable in struct `Parameter` 
- the token can negatively or positvely rebase
- -  in case of negative rebase for example it rebse negatively from 100e18 to 80e18
- - -  now the first eight users withdrawing will get their 10e18 back and two people will not have any thing
- - in case of positive rebase the following would happen
- - - the token rebase from 100e18 to 150e18 for example
- - - 10 users withdraw their token normally but 50e18 would stay stuck at the contract, in addition the users would in theory have lost the positive rebase
- - - - to iterate through their loss during positive rebase (a token valued at 100$ and they hold 10 (1k$) each, when positive rebase happens, alot of selling pressure happens making the price go to 75$) now if they could have gotten their positive rebase then this wouldn't be a problem, but they lost it and is stuck in the contract

This always the problem of interacting with rebasing tokens, we can't interact with rebasing token during the normal increment of storage variables during `deposit` or `withdraws` 


## Impact

High - Loss of funds for the stakers of that specific Pool

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Either prevent (blacklists) the ability of creating Pools with Rebasing tokens, or implement a logic around those specific Pools (Vault Tokens for example) `ERC4626` that gives the users `shares` to the Pool so that they have a % from depsoits in the Pool whether a rebasing happens or not
