# User fund loss if address is blacklisted in USDT or USDC during withdraw and emergencyWithdraw functions

## Summary
The `MasterChef::withdraw` and `MasterChef::emergencyWithdraw` functions may face issues if the contract or user addresses are blacklisted by admin-controlled tokens (e.g., USDC, USDT). This can result in blocked transfers, potentially trapping funds within the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
Malicious or compromised token owners can blacklist contract addresses, preventing transfers to and from these addresses. This can happen due to regulatory actions, extortion attempts, or targeted attacks against users interacting with the contract. If an address is blacklisted, any attempt to withdraw funds will fail, causing the transaction to revert and potentially locking user funds in the contract.


## Impact
Users may be unable to withdraw their funds if the contract address or their own address is blacklisted

```solidity
function withdraw(uint256 pid, uint256 amount) external override {
    _modify(pid, msg.sender, -amount.toInt256(), true);

    if (amount > 0) _farms[pid].token.safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);
}

function emergencyWithdraw(uint256 pid) external override {
    Farm storage farm = _farms[pid];

    uint256 balance = farm.amounts.getAmountOf(msg.sender);
    int256 deltaAmount = -balance.toInt256();

    farm.amounts.update(msg.sender, deltaAmount);

    farm.token.safeTransfer(msg.sender, balance);

    emit PositionModified(pid, msg.sender, deltaAmount, 0);
}
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add user parameter in both function

```solidity
function withdraw(uint256 pid, uint256 amount,address user) external override {
        _modify(pid, msg.sender, -amount.toInt256(), true);
     -  if (amount > 0) _farms[pid].token.safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);
    +  if (amount > 0) _farms[pid].token.safeTransfer(user, amount);
}

function emergencyWithdraw(uint256 pid,address user) external override {
    Farm storage farm = _farms[pid];

    uint256 balance = farm.amounts.getAmountOf(msg.sender);
    int256 deltaAmount = -balance.toInt256();

    farm.amounts.update(msg.sender, deltaAmount);

    - farm.token.safeTransfer(msg.sender, balance);
   + farm.token.safeTransfer(user, balance);

    emit PositionModified(pid, msg.sender, deltaAmount, 0);
}
```
