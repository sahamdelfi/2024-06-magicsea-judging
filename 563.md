# `_notifyBribes()` accounts the bribe rewarders for much more deltaAmount than it should

## Summary
When notifying the bribes we are using the `deposit()` function from the `BribeRewarder`. The problem comes because in the `_notifyBribes()` we are sending the whole `deltaAmount` to each one of the rewarders. We are not distributing it evenly, so if a user sends 5 `deltaAmount` and there are 3 rewarders, it will send 5 `deltaAmount` to each one of them which will result in overinflating the rewards.
 
## Vulnerability Detail
This is where the `deposit()` from `BribeRewarder.sol` is called

```solidity
 function _notifyBribes(
        uint256 periodId,
        address pool,
        uint256 tokenId,
        uint256 deltaAmount
    ) private {
>>      IBribeRewarder[] storage rewarders = _bribesPerPriod[periodId][pool];
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < rewarders.length; ++i) {
            if (address(rewarders[i]) != address(0)) {
>>              rewarders[i].deposit(periodId, tokenId, deltaAmount);
                _userBribesPerPeriod[periodId][tokenId].push(rewarders[i]);
            }
        }
    }
```

As we can see we are passing the `deltaAmount` for each one of the rewarders, which means that every rewarder will account rewards for the whole `deltaAmount` of the staker. It is not distributed evenly. This will lead to every rewarded accumulating rewards for the whole amount that the staker sent which means that everyone will get much more rewards than they have to

## Impact

High because the rewards are overinflated and everyone will receive much more from the bribes than they are eligible for

## Recommendation

Divide the `deltaAmount` evenly when depositing into the rewarders like this

```diff
function _notifyBribes(
        uint256 periodId,
        address pool,
        uint256 tokenId,
        uint256 deltaAmount
    ) private {
        IBribeRewarder[] storage rewarders = _bribesPerPriod[periodId][pool];
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < rewarders.length; ++i) {
            if (address(rewarders[i]) != address(0)) {
               
-               rewarders[i].deposit(periodId, tokenId, deltaAmount);
+               rewarders[i].deposit(periodId, tokenId, deltaAmount / rewarders.length);
                _userBribesPerPeriod[periodId][tokenId].push(rewarders[i]);
            }
        }
    }

```
