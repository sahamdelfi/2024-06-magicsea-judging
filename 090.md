# Total LUM rewards may be distributed for exeeding the `_lumPerSecond`.

## Summary
LUM rewards for a pool are calculated by elapsed time from `lastUpdateTimestamp` and `weights[pid]`.
`Voter.sol#setTopPoolIdsWithWeights` function updates the `weights[pid]` but not update the `lastUpdateTimestamp` of the pool to the `block.timestamp`.
Therefore, the total LUM rewards may exceed the `_lumPerSecond` due to the inflation of elapsed time from `lastUpdateTime`.

## Vulnerability Detail
Scenario:
1. Assume that there are one top pools `poolA` with weight `100%` at time `T0`.
2. Assume that there is activity on `poolA` at time `T1`( > `T0`), thus the LUM rewards are distributed `_lumPerSecond` (`100%`) per second to `poolA` for time `[T0, T1]` and the `lastUpdateTimestamp` of `poolA` is `T1`.
3. Assume that there is no activity on `poolB` during the time `[T0, T1]`, thus the `lastUpdateTimestamp` of `poolB` is `T0`.
4. Assume that administrator update the `poolA`'s weight to `0%` and `poolB`'s weight to `100%` at time `T2` ( > `T1`).
5. Assume that there is activity on `poolB` at time `T3`( > `T2`). Since the `lastUpdateTimestamp` of `poolB` is `T0`, the Total LUM rewards are distributed `_lumPerSecond` (`100%`) per second for the time `[T0, T1]`.
6. As a result, the Total LUM rewards are distributed `_lumPerSecond * 2` (`200%`) per second for the time `[T0, T1]`.

## Impact
Total LUM rewards may be distributed for exeeding the `_lumPerSecond`.

## Recommendation
Modify the `Voter.sol#setTopPoolIdsWithWeights` function as follows.
```solidity
    function setTopPoolIdsWithWeights(uint256[] calldata pids, uint256[] calldata weights) external {
        if (msg.sender != _operator) _checkOwner();

        uint256 length = pids.length;
        if (length != weights.length) revert IVoter__InvalidLength();

        uint256[] memory oldIds = _topPids.values();

++      _masterChef.updateAll(oldPids);
++      _masterChef.updateAll(pids);


        if (oldIds.length > 0) {
            // masterchef snould be updated beforehand

            for (uint256 i = oldIds.length; i > 0;) {
                uint256 pid = oldIds[--i];

                _topPids.remove(pid);
                _weights[pid] = 0;
            }
        }

        for (uint256 i; i < length; ++i) {
            uint256 pid = pids[i];
            if (!_topPids.add(pid)) revert IVoter__DuplicatePoolId(pid);
        }

        uint256 totalWeights;
        for (uint256 i; i < length; ++i) {
            uint256 pid = pids[i];

            uint256 weight = weights[i];

            _weights[pid] = weight;

            totalWeights += weight;
        }

        _topPidsTotalWeights = totalWeights;

        emit TopPoolIdsWithWeightsSet(pids, weights);
    }
```
