# Potential Denial of Service over excessive looping on the array of farm

## Summary
The `getPendingRewards` function is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to an unbounded loop over an array of farm IDs provided by the user. This  can make the function unusable as the number of farms grows or if a malicious user offers a large array of IDs

## Vulnerability Detail
The `getPendingRewards` iterates over an array of pool IDs `pids` provided by the user. For each ID, it performs several operations, including storage reads. As the number of farms increases or if a user provides a large array of IDs, the gas cost of this function could exceed the block gas limit, causing the function to fail.

## Impact
The contract could become partially or completely unusable as the `claim` functions rely on `getPendingRewards`. And Users may be unable to query their pending rewards if the number of farms becomes too large.

To demonstrate this vulnerability

1. I am deploying the MasterChef contract with many farms (e.g., 1000).
2. Call `getPendingRewards` with an array of all farm IDs.
3. Observe that the transaction fails due to an out-of-gas error.
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Optimize the farm data structure for more efficient access and iteration.  or Limit the number of farms that can be queried in a single call
