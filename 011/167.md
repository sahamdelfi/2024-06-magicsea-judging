# Fully withdrawing from a lock will result in permanent loss of unclaimed bribes

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

In order to claim a bribe, voters must call `BribeRewarder#claim`, which in turn uses `_modify`, which [validates](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/rewarders/BribeRewarder.sol#L264-L266) the caller's ownership of the `tokenId`.

However, once a voter withdraws all locked MLUM via `MlumStaking#withdrawFromPosition`, it [would destroy](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/MlumStaking.sol#L643) his `tokenId` (removing the ownership), therefore the bribes that belong to this `tokenId` would not be claimable anymore.

## Impact

Loss of bribes if a `tokenId` was fully withdrawn before claiming its bribes.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

```diff
+ mapping(uint256 => bool) isWithdrawn;
    function _destroyPosition(uint256 tokenId) internal {
        delete _stakingPositions[tokenId];
+       isWithdrawn[tokenId] = true;
-       ERC721Upgradeable._burn(tokenId);
    }
```

Add `require(!isWithdrawn[tokenId])` to functions `addToPosition`, `renewLockPosition`, `extendLockPosition`.
