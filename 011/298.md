# User that withdraws from position loses unclaimed bribes rewards

## Summary

Users stake tokens in the `MlumStaking` contract and receive a non-transferable NFT with a specific `tokenId`, enabling voting and bribe accumulation. However, rewards tied to the `tokenId` can only be claimed by the token owner. Withdrawing the staked tokens destroys the NFT, making it impossible to claim the rewards.

## Vulnerability Detail

Users deposit staked tokens into the `MlumStaking` contract, which [mints](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/MlumStaking.sol#L611) a non-transferable NFT with a given `tokenId`. This NFT grants the user the ability to [vote](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/Voter.sol#L160-L163) via the `Voter` contract and accumulate bribes from `BribeRewarder`s contracts associated with the voted pool. The issue is that the bribe rewards are [linked to the `tokenId` ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/rewarders/BribeRewarder.sol#L296)of the position rather than the owner of that position, and rewards can only be [claimed by the owner](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-magicsea/blob/main/magicsea-staking/src/rewarders/BribeRewarder.sol#L264-L266) of the given `tokenId`. This leads to a scenario where if the user withdraws the staked amount from the position, the NFT is destroyed, and the user can no longer claim rewards since the NFT with the given `tokenId` no longer exists

**Issue Scenario:**
1. User opens a position in `MlumStaking`.
2. User votes on pools that have associated bribes.
3. User accumulates a significant amount of bribes in the form of rewards.
4. User decides to withdraw from the `MlumStaking` position.
5. User cannot claim rewards from any `BribeRewarder` contracts since the tokenId associated with the rewards no longer exists.

## Impact

Users' bribes in the form of rewards are stuck in the `BribeRewarder` contracts and cannot be claimed.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to track the amount of accumulated rewards in `BribeRewards` by the NFT owner rather than by the `tokenId`.
