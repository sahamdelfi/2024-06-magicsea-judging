# MlumStaking.sol#withdrawFromPosition - Staker is unable to claim his bribe rewards

## Summary
If a user hasn't claimed his bribe rewards but withdraws his staked amount, his NFT is burnt and he can't claim his bribe rewards. 

## Vulnerability Detail
When staking users get an NFT that represents their staking. With this NFT, he can vote. If he vote for a pool with bribes rewardes, he earns rewards for his voting. He can gets the rewards once the voting period is over by using his tokenId. 

After his staking expires, he can withdraw his staked amount. When this happens, the NFT is burnt. On withdrawing it is not checked if the user claims his rewards from the BribeRewarder.sol. This will make his rewards stuck there forever since he won't be able to claim them because his NFT was burnt on the withdrawal.
