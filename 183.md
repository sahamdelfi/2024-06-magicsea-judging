# Bribe rewards accumulated from start of voting period to first vote are lost

## Summary
Unassigned rewards whilst no one has voted for a pool will be lost.

## Vulnerability Detail
Rewards are streamed per second in `BribeRewarder` for the duration of the voting period. While no one has voted for that pool, the rewards remain unassigned and are lost, as there isn't a function to sweep up the rewards, and neither can it be rolled over to future voting periods because `bribe()` / `fundAndBribe()` can only be called once.

## POC
Insert this test into `BribeRewarder.t.sol`.
```solidity
function testLostRewards() public {
  ERC20Mock(address(rewardToken)).mint(address(this), 10e18);
  ERC20Mock(address(rewardToken)).approve(address(rewarder), 10e18);

  rewarder.fundAndBribe(1, 1, 10e18);

  _voterMock.setCurrentPeriod(1);
  _voterMock.setStartAndEndTime(100, 200);

  // join midway through voting period
  vm.warp(150);
  vm.prank(address(_voterMock));
  rewarder.deposit(1, 1, 1e18);

  // warp to end of vote
  vm.warp(200);
  _voterMock.setCurrentPeriod(2);
  _voterMock.setLatestFinishedPeriod(1);

  // only half of rewards are claimable
  vm.prank(alice);
  assertEq(5e18, rewarder.getPendingReward(1));
  rewarder.claim(1);

  // rewards are lost
  assertGt(rewardToken.balanceOf(address(rewarder)), 0);
}
```

## Impact
Permanent loss of rewards.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Rewards should only start streaming from the first vote, and in the extreme case where no one votes for a pool, implement sweeping rewards.
