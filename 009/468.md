# `MasterChefRewarder` does not support claiming extra rewards directly from the contract which will prevent users from claiming unclaimed rewards when `MasterChefRewarder` is unlinked from `MasterChef`

## Summary

`MasterChefRewarder` does not support claiming extra rewards directly from the contract which will prevent users from claiming unclaimed rewards when `MasterChefRewarder` is unlinked from `MasterChef`.

## Vulnerability Detail

The protocol can set a farm's `extraRewarder` by calling `MasterChef#setExtraRewarder`

when there is already an `extraRewarder`, the old `extraRewarder` will be unlinked from `MasterChef`.

Since there is no functions for users to claim the extra rewards directly from `extraRewarder`, the unclaimed rewards will be stuck in `extraRewarder`. By design, the unlinked `extraRewarder` can not be linked back to `MasterChef`, which will cause the funds to be lost forever. Note that, the function `extraRewarder#sweep` can only sweep rewards that have not credited to users.

## Impact

When a `MasterChefRewarder` unlinked from `MasterChef`, the unclaimed rewards in `MasterChefRewarder` will be lost forever.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Add a storage variable `Amounts.Parameter` in `MasterChefRewarder` to track the deposited tokens
- Implement a function in `MasterChefRewarder` that users call to claim rewards base on the deposited tokens of users.
