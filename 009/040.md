# Changing extraRewarder in MasterchefV2 may cause depositors lose some extra rewards

## Summary
Masterchefv2's extra rewarder can be changed. Once Masterchefv2's extra rewarder is changed, depositors may lose some extra rewards.

## Vulnerability Detail
In masterchef contract, the owner has the right to update the extra rewards. In `_setExtraRewarder()` function, masterchef will unlink with the previous extra rewarder and link with the new extra rewarder. From the function's logic, it's possible to change the extra rewarder for the owner.

```javascript
    function _setExtraRewarder(uint256 pid, IMasterChefRewarder extraRewarder) private {
        ......
        IMasterChefRewarder oldExtraRewarder = _farms[pid].extraRewarder;

        if (address(oldExtraRewarder) != address(0)) oldExtraRewarder.unlink(pid);
        if (address(extraRewarder) != address(0)) extraRewarder.link(pid);

        _farms[pid].extraRewarder = extraRewarder;

        emit ExtraRewarderSet(pid, extraRewarder);
    }
```
In masterchefRewarder, we will calculate total rewards between block.timestamp(or endTimestamp) and lastUpdateTimestamp.
The vulnerability is that once we change the extra rewarder, the `lastUpdateTimestamp` will be changed. In one newly created masterchefRewarder, the initial `lastUpdateTimestamp` cannot be less that current `lastUpdateTimestamp`. Considering that if there is no deposit/withdraw in the previous extra rewarder for a long time. The `lastUpdateTimestamp` in previous extra rewarder might be less than block.timestamp a lot. This will cause depositors lose some expected rewards.
```c
    function getTotalRewards(
        Parameter storage rewarder,
        uint256 rewardPerSecond,
        uint256 endTimestamp,
        uint256 totalSupply
    ) internal view returns (uint256) {
        if (totalSupply == 0) return 0;

        uint256 lastUpdateTimestamp = rewarder.lastUpdateTimestamp;
        uint256 timestamp = block.timestamp > endTimestamp ? endTimestamp : block.timestamp;

        return timestamp > lastUpdateTimestamp ? (timestamp - lastUpdateTimestamp) * rewardPerSecond : 0;
    }
```
## Impact
Depositors may lose some extra rewards.
