# User will lose all his secondary rewards if the extra rewarder gets updated while he is staking

## Summary
If a user stakes tokens in the masterchefV2 and the Extra Rewarder gets changed while the user tokens are staked he will loose all his rewards from the previous rewarder

## Vulnerability Detail
A users rewards from the masterchef rewarder are sent to him everytime he: deposits,withrawls,claim rewards or the trustee deposits for him and this is done by calling `onModify`
- Now alice deposits 100 tokens
- Now non of the actions decribed above the causes `onModify` to be called on here account happen
- After 10 days at a rate of 1 reward token per day for 1 deposited token she has 1000 reward tokens.
- Before alice claims the rewards `_setExtraRewarder` is called and the extra rewarder is changed
- now alice calls claim but recieves nothing
## Impact
The issue outlined above will cause loss of funds to users who did not get their rewards yet and the damage will depend on how frequently the rewarder is updated
